a2p1U000000RowfQAC,0011U00000rjFKdQAM,"I showed up for my appointment, but they had me double booked, so we didn't get to meet with the doctor for very long, and had an expedited visit. The doctor and staff were extremely friendly and apologized, and the office environment was very nice!"
a2p1U000000RqQqQAK,0011U00000riCSHQA2,"Staff was polite, courteous, and on time"
a2p1U000000RqXyQAK,0011U00000riTw7QAE,Overall care is great!  It's wonderful to be able to spend 45-60 minutes with the actual Dr.
a2p1U000000Rq1LQAS,0011U00000rhu8eQAA,Like the doctor and staff at this location. Easy to get any appointment.
a2p1U000000RpiuQAC,0011U00000rk4SHQAY,The convenience and the doctors
a2p3g000000KzuuAAC,0011U00000rirxUQAQ,They are very good about returning calls
a2p1U000000RpqKQAS,0011U00000risiJQAQ,I like the convenience of the location to my work and I like one provider who will keep track of all of my other providers etc.  I was sick and they were able to help me and had the PX right there so I didn't have to go to another place to fill my prescription.
a2p1U000000RtQEQA0,0011U00000rjB7TQAU,Appt ease Dr spends time Thorough Close to work
a2p3g000000oRofAAE,0011U00000rjLlvQAE,I WAS IN A LOT OF DISCOMFORT YESTERDAY AND APPRECIATED THE QUICK RESPONSE
a2p1U000000l8LBQAY,0011U00000ri5sIQAQ,Focus on preventative services.  My lipids panel was not included my fasting blood work.
a2p1U000000RqKhQAK,0011U00000rjm6mQAA,Not Sure
a2p3g000000LAfOAAW,0011U00000rjQabQAE,"It is a good set up if you can get it for free through the State, as I can. I was in need of a primary care doctor and wanted an actual doctor, not a nurse practitioner, and I was struggling to find one through my insurance company."
a2p3g000000oeYqAAI,0011U00000ri7RvQAI,I don't have enough experience with XYZ to make a recommendation yet.
a2p3g000000KzC1AAK,0011U00000rk2qDQAQ,no copay like my provider
a2p1U000000RtQRQA0,0011U00000rii6CQAQ,"Quick appointments, personalized care, low cost"
a2p1U000000RqR1QAK,0011U00000rjX9aQAE,"Great Customer Service by the Doctor, but a little delayed in getting test results back in a timely manner"
a2p3g000000qQgvAAE,0011U00000rii6MQAQ,The experience so far has been positive and less expensive than my prior insurance plan.
a2p4w000002NzYGAA0,0011U00000rjcbPQAQ,"Minimizes healthcare costs, convenient on site clinic, know and like the staff"
a2p3g000000qZqKAAU,0011U00000riUViQAM,a confirmation of appointment came at 2:27 and telling the appointment was at 3:00
a2p3g000000qhtWAAQ,0011U00000ri6QPQAY,ease of appt and time
a2p4w000001ptvbAAA,0011U00000rjkkSQAQ,"I wish the practice was affiliated with a hospital. Otherwise, it would be a 10!"
a2p4w000001pnTlAAI,0013g00000CxTSmAAN,Maybe not sure of service yet
a2p4w000002Jp51AAC,0011U00000rjzgKQAQ,I feel like my doctor spent the majority of my time trying to convince me these covid injections are safe and my reason for this visit had nothing to do with these injections. I will NEVER inject that poison into my body. My Creator made me perfectly and I have absolute zero fear about any virus.
a2p4w000002JyhTAAS,0011U00000ri30nQAA,Good program
a2p4w000002JxpRAAS,0011U00000rj7eAQAQ,"Friendly, professional staff.  Very enjoyable bedside manner.  It was my wifes first visit to Dr. Davidson and she
was quite comfortable and enjoyed the care."
a2p4w000002Jyi7AAC,0011U00000rhulkQAA,"They're accessible, and so far, they've had good staff"
a2p3g000000qcpjAAA,0013g000009jwfTAAQ,Great doctor. Location is awesome
a2p4w000002JqAHAA0,0011U00000rjx2OQAQ,not everyone has access to this concierge service
a2p4w000001prRyAAI,0013g000007ZWjTAAW,I think it would fit our family’s needs.
a2p4w000001piMfAAI,0011U00000rkCNMQA2,I do not know whether they have a preferred clinic or physician elsewhere outside of XYZ.
a2p4w000001pxriAAA,0011U00000sh1M8QAI,Convenience
a2p3g000000qnlTAAQ,0013g00000KS7wAAAT,Doctor seemed attentive and knowledgeable.
a2p3g000000qiseAAA,0013g00000CyYNKAA3,Handy clinic location. I liked the doctor. Hate the portal.
a2p3g000000qZqjAAE,0011U00000riZp6QAE,Having to constantly go to another facility for imaging is garbage. Nice to have multiple locations though
a2p4w000002JtZAAA0,0013g000002vOl4AAE,Can get in for an appointment and take care of basics; practitioners show interest in patient wellbeing. Some limitations but good program overall.
a2p3g000000qolZAAQ,0013g00000CyO8HAAV,"I've yet to have an in-person appointment, but I've been very impressed with the ease of reaching a provider, and the professional, prompt care I received over the phone."
a2p4w000002K0d9AAC,0011U00000rjCcCQAU,"If one is under 65 it is a great option to have but since the over 65 people are not served by XYZ, that makes it not as useful."
a2p4w000001pkH8AAI,0013g0000091fF0AAI,"The Doctor that saw me that day, could of been more personable"
a2p4w000001pqQBAAY,0011U00000rilIVQAY,"they called me told me they made me an appt for specialist .when i called the dr they said they are only in Louisville, not in IN and they did not have me down for an appt  -,so called XYZ and they called me back with another doctor to call and set up my own  appt"
a2p1U000000RpaXQAS,0011U00000rjUE6QAM,"Convenient location, timely and quality service."
a2p3g000000KysqAAC,0011U00000risWOQAY,good service
a2p1U000000RoalQAC,0011U00000rjYMWQA2,"Quick, friendly service, pharmacy on hand so didn't have to make another run to the pharmacy"
a2p1U000000RprrQAC,0011U00000rigjxQAA,Good experience. Quick follow up.
a2p1U000000RtL3QAK,0011U00000rjm6nQAA,It'seems an option with our city plan.
a2p1U000000RpQFQA0,0011U00000rjFWWQA2,"From my initial visit, it seems like a convenient set up with helpful services."
a2p1U000000Rt6aQAC,0011U00000rjqqkQAA,"Well, they can't join XYZ unless their employer participates."
a2p1U000000RpcHQAS,0011U00000riornQAA,Great customer service!
a2p3g000000oRXUAA2,0011U00000riBXPQA2,"Convenient, and like the Doctors and Katie"
a2p3g000000KzE3AAK,0011U00000rjhxlQAA,"Appointments are pretty easy to get so far.  And having prescriptions, and a lab on hand make it easier."
a2p1U000000RqQJQA0,0011U00000rjC3DQAU,"accessibility is very good.  The MA, Bethany, at the Arvada clinic is excellent.  I have not seen Dr Shuherk yet."
a2p1U000000RsodQAC,0011U00000rjRNyQAM,"While the appt. was speedy to get (same day), I didn't have great service."
a2p1U000000RqBdQAK,0011U00000riBkgQAE,"easy convenient scheduling, good amount of time with the doctor."
a2p3g000000KynLAAS,0011U00000rjQabQAE,"If you are a state employee, it is a good deal."
a2p1U000000RqEzQAK,0011U00000ri70lQAA,The doctor took time to get to know my health history and addressed any health concerns I had during my appointment.
a2p1U000000RqY5QAK,0011U00000sgyVZQAY,Love Dr. Robertson
a2p1U000000RtSkQAK,0011U00000riQP6QAM,I really liked Dr. DeAlleaume and the time that she took to get to know my son and my health.   I felt the care right then and there.
a2p3g000000pIvsAAE,0011U00000riFIoQAM,Easy to make appointments. Dr spends quality time with you
a2p3g000000owMAAAY,0011U00000rja9yQAA,Easy to get appt. nice people

a2p3g000000owNcAAI,0011U00000risDVQAY,"I appreciate the time that they will commit to the patient. They invest their time to learn about their patient and how they can best serve them. In-house lab work is a plus, many of their services that are done in house are covered 100%."
a2p3g000000osHTAAY,0011U00001Bf8N5QAJ,Please tell us why
a2p3g000000owO0AAI,0011U00000rhvAcQAI,"The attentive nature of the staff, but especially the doctor and the time they were able to spend with me."
a2p3g000000p2CIAAY,0011U000019xyaZQAQ,"I had a biometric screening and the person that did the screening wrote my numbers/info on a post-it note, my name was never written down attached to my info. My blood was then drawn and put into a tube that did not have my name on it."
a2p3g000000pEwrAAE,0011U00000riqiYQAQ,"My last two interactions with Dr. Black and the office staff have been great!  However, my husband and I have had multiple instances where XYZ was supposed to call us back and did not.  One of these was when I spoke to Dr. Bernardy in late June with a CoVID diagnosis.  She never called back.  Prior to that, after seeing his XYZ doctor on telehealth and in-person appointments my husband was waiting for a referral to have a specialist take a sample of a lesion. He was never contacted, despite him reaching out a couple of times and then me reaching out and expressing our significant displeasure for the lack of responsiveness, especially given the potential seriousness of the lesion that required more expertise than the general practitioner.  We have gone with XYZ because of your model which it to provide more personalized care than a regular PPO provider.  This has certainly not been our experience in these cases, and in fact the level of service is far below any expectations for any medical provider."
a2p3g000000pHqSAAU,0011U00000riZpOQAU,"Personal service, very available for appointments"
a2p3g000000plxJAAQ,0011U00000rjS2RQAU,No co-pay for office visits.
a2p3g000000p4c0AAA,0011U00000ricZ2QAI,"Convenience to office, efficiency of location."
a2p3g000000phCxAAI,0013g000007a7mhAAA,"They would not let me be seen in person, and did absolutely nothing for my PINK EYE."
a2p3g000000ou9HAAQ,0011U00000rjsCoQAI,It's always been easy to get an appointment. Each visit has felt very comfortable and personalized. I appreciate the amount of time spent understanding my medical history.
a2p3g000000pitdAAA,0013g00000Bl3iPAAR,"Quality assistance, easy appointment time, quick access to a doctor"
a2p3g000000pg9dAAA,0011U00000ricVNQAY,Quick and easy.  Able to speak with a doctor over the phone in a timely manner.
a2p3g000000pGyaAAE,0011U00000riztyQAA,The doctor took plenty of time to answer my questions and look into any concerns I had.
a2p3g000000p8EpAAI,0011U00000rjGFjQAM,Ease of use
a2p3g000000oyJuAAI,0011U000019xyb2QAA,Wasn’t very clean and very dated office soace
a2p3g000000pPHQAA2,0011U00000rjVkJQAU,I feel like I'm listened to and my concerns are all addressed. It's also just a really friendly environment.
a2p3g000000pZA5AAM,0013g00000B4lU4AAJ,"only had a blood test done, !st time there, took 5 min, the receptionist/girl who drew blood was very nice,and did a good job. cant really form an opinion on that quick little visit."
a2p3g000000pEvKAAU,0011U00000rivGHQAY,I had to wait a week and a half for an appointment.
a2p3g000000ptZ5AAI,0011U00000riBIUQA2,"The clinic is in-network. Easy to schedule, clear communications, friendly staff."
a2p3g000000pVDFAA2,0013g000006uJT1AAM,"First visit - hard to tell from just one visit, one experience. I was overall very impressed but will need a bit more time to make a full assessment."
a2p3g000000pHs4AAE,0011U00000rjY8JQAU,So far what I have experienced has been positive but I'm not really clear on how this integrates with my Horizon providers.
a2p1U000000RqFiQAK,0011U00000riwpfQAA,It was a good visit but only my first one so I am not exactly sure how I feel yet.
a2p3g000000LAg4AAG,0011U00000rk3RyQAI,"Friendly staff, timely appointment setup, adequate time to discuss/address health issues."
a2p1U000000RtTIQA0,0011U00000rjVupQAE,"Helpful, convient, fast"
a2p1U000000RolYQAS,0011U00000rk9cIQAQ,It's getting better but the constant change in staff was tough
a2p1U000000RprRQAS,0011U00000riLA6QAM,Rapid appts. Personalized care
a2p1U000000RoH8QAK,0011U00000rhvAaQAI,I was pleased with my appt.  Dr Thomas was thorough and professional.   This was my first appt.
a2p3g000000LAdEAAW,0011U00001An2a0QAB,Phone kept freezing up..
a2p1U000000RpeGQAS,0011U00000rhu8eQAA,Good service. Attention to patient care. Easy to get appointment when needed quickly.
a2p1U000000RtMBQA0,0011U00000rj4GvQAI,The Dr listened to my concurs and was  very friendly
a2p1U000000RpXdQAK,0011U00000riMCFQA2,"I initially liked what XYZ said they offer. I was with one doctor 2 years and it cost me much more than had I continued with my primary care doctor. Due to an illness, I've seen 3 specialists who have pretty much milked it and my doctor with XYZ could not do much, though she was very nice. I am now seeing a different XYZ doctor and receiving some helpful input to bettering my condition. That said, I would not recommend XYZ to others."
a2p1U000000Rsa0QAC,0011U00000rhxs0QAA,Friendly service and great follow up.
a2p3g000000KyuLAAS,0011U00001AmvpmQAB,I really like the time that the doctor took with me and the fact that he called me personally with my test results a few days later.
a2p1U000000RuwyQAC,0011U00000rk6zIQAQ,Though exam
a2p1U000000RsgjQAC,0011U00000rjxilQAA,Great experience all around. From the medical assistant to the doctor we felt like people and that we were listened to. We also felt like we were in good hands and the staff went above and beyond.
a2p1U000000Rq8FQAS,0011U00000rjZ0lQAE,I love that clinic. They are all so nice
a2p1U000000RqcrQAC,0011U00000ri9XTQAY,good MD
a2p1U000000RtCpQAK,0011U00000rjQdOQAU,"Due to the great staff, how soon you can be seen by a Doctor, and affordability."
a2p1U000000Rq8nQAC,0011U00000rjiVSQAY,I was seen within hours of calling and everyone was very helpful and friendly.
a2p1U000000RpqnQAC,0011U00000ri93NQAQ,I was misdiagnosed and ended up in an urgent care 2 days later.
a2p1U000000RqOXQA0,0011U00000rjC3DQAU,I have not used it enough and I feel the logistics between the 2 clinics and records passing back and forth between facilities is not worked out yet.
a2p1U000000Rq6QQAS,0011U00000riEIDQA2,prompt service cost was cheap
a2p1U000000l8GGQAY,0011U00000rjyaVQAQ,Did not care for the doctor I saw.  He is nothing like Dr.Song
a2p1U000000l8FjQAI,0011U00000rjeuCQAQ,I like Dr. Jennifer Watson.
a2p1U000000RqeTQAS,0011U00000rjWhpQAE,the ability to have longer visits with the doctors to cover all issues.
a2p1U000000RppwQAC,0011U00000rjM3CQAU,"This program was promoted as a way to see a doctor quickly and lessen the time away from work. I work in Puyallup. I was sick and requested an appointment on Thursday for vertigo, ear and sinus infection. The Dr. in Puyallup had no openings, called and wanted me to drive to Tacoma the following day at 11:30 to be seen. I went to Sound Family medicine and was treated the same day."
a2p1U000000RtLfQAK,0011U00000riLmRQAU,Very patient focused
a2p1U000000RpFvQAK,0011U00000rjnb0QAA,"Great place, very friendly environment, the doctor Nina and Tina the nurse are the best! They make feel that I can tell them anything and will be listened."

a2p1U000000RoSZQA0,0011U00000riX1JQAU,Easy to get in and out. My doctor is friendly.
a2p1U000000RtD2QAK,0011U00000rjW4jQAE,"I don't care for the new doctor, Dr. McCay. The nursing staff is still phenomenal, but Dr. Noble was much more personable and eager to help his patients in any way he could."
a2p1U000000RpoGQAS,0011U00000riR0fQAE,takes so long
a2p3g000000KyqjAAC,0011U00000rk6dBQAQ,Close to work
a2p1U000000RsxzQAC,0011U00000rimiBQAQ,Very thorough first visit. Definitely felt as though there was adequate time to discus health issues.
a2p1U000000RqCnQAK,0011U00000rjnypQAA,I felt very cared for. I felt compassion from all I encountered. I love that they seek to get people off of meds by choosing healthier lifestyles.
a2p3g000000L1OBAA0,0011U00000ridpoQAA,helpful and financially beneficial
a2p1U000000RoZvQAK,0011U00000rj5fcQAA,Felt like I didn't get the care I needed
a2p1U000000l8CHQAY,0011U00000rkBYaQAM,Convenient and easy
a2p1U000000RoTvQAK,0011U00000rjvUhQAI,I usually don't refer places to anyone.
a2p1U000000RqKeQAK,0011U00000sgyb3QAA,Was able to get an appointment quickly.  Dr. took alot of time with me.
a2p1U000000RqccQAC,0011U00000rj1FgQAI,I enjoy the convenience of XYZ and the lack of crowds and long waiting times.
a2p1U000000l8ESQAY,0011U00000rhrvCQAQ,It's inexpensive and convenient.

a2p1U000000RvGWQA0,0011U00000riIUZQA2,"It is convenient, and easily accessible"
a2p1U000000RsofQAC,0011U00000ri6NyQAI,Only been to the office twice (once to make the appointment and the second time for the appointment). Staff was courteous and I didn't have to wait long. Dr. Giles took time to let me ask questions and seemed very engaged and provided detailed answers.
a2p1U000000Rqc1QAC,0011U00000rjYVQQA2,Staff is very personable and approachable.
a2p1U000000RqBgQAK,0011U00000rjaijQAA,"Great doctor, took the time in discussing issues and providing information regarding the issues."

a2p1U000000Rom9QAC,0011U00000rk5e2QAA,"Location is convenient and staff is friendly and professional.  Plus, they treat you like family."
a2p1U000000Rsa5QAC,0011U00000rjUilQAE,"First time I've visited - very pleasant, nice friendly staff - but not enough time/experience to give a resounding recommendation yet. Called on Monday, couldn't get appointment before Thursday - not the exactly the see us on a moments notice that was advertised."
a2p3g000000LAfxAAG,0011U00000rjectQAA,"easy to schedule, no long wait, available appt dates"
a2p1U000000Rt4EQAS,0011U00000riW6JQAU,"Easy to get an appointment, short wait times, very helpful financially."
a2p4w000002O4WyAAK,0014w000031qdQlAAI,When you are sick the clinic is never open.  You have to do a phone call or a video chat with them.
a2p4w000002O47eAAC,0011U00000rjlJ6QAI,"I have seen Terri, PA twice now for wellness exams. She seems rushed and abrupt. I get the sense that she is competent and knowledgeable, but she doesn't seem interested in me as a whole person. I have been VERY pleased with other staff I have met for urgent care."
a2p1U000000Ro4ZQAS,0011U00000rjn7iQAA,"Not bad but not excellent service.  I feel like my time is not/was not valued.  Even when scheduling an appointment and every time I've gone in, I've had to wait.  Having to wait when I was the only one in the clinic had me raising an eye brow......"
a2p1U000000Rq1NQAS,0011U00000rjF5rQAE,Easy to use
a2p1U000000Ro7SQAS,0011U00000rj7gbQAA,Easy and convenient to make appointments. My doctor is excellent. I feel like I get personal attention.
a2p1U000000RqGMQA0,0011U00000riwAwQAI,Like my Dr. But the hours are tough. Called Sat night with a fever and there is no one to help me.
a2p1U000000RopKQAS,0011U00000rikoLQAQ,I work for a municipality and all employees use XYZ
a2p1U000000RsWeQAK,0011U00000riWj2QAE,First visit. It seems my coast guard physical that was filled out during my yearly physical is lost. Two days after my physical I called Morgan with the request to call in my prescription to the HWY 41 harris teether pharmacy. Today (Saturday) my wife had to beg for 3 pills because it wasn't called in. Never had that problem with my old doctors office.
a2p1U000000RsVhQAK,0011U00000riK5hQAE,"great service, no wait,"
a2p1U000000RtDVQA0,0011U00000rjhvXQAQ,"no wait, respectful of my time"
a2p1U000000RpmUQAS,0011U00000rjNzaQAE,Not sure if Dr. John Reiskytl is the right fit.

a2p1U000000RtHIQA0,0011U00000rjhepQAA,It is convenient and easy to schedule an appointment.
a2p1U000000RsWaQAK,0011U00000rjhepQAA,I got right in and got personal attention.
a2p3g000000pW6PAAU,0011U000019xyTDQAY,XYZ is not available in the area I live in.
a2p1U000000l8F2QAI,0011U00000riuKTQAY,Worst experience ever..nurse and dr. lied to my face then to my wife. Said she would tie my wife down to draw blood. Head person in charge didnt care that her workers lied to us. She didnt nothing about it
a2p1U000000RswFQAS,0011U00000riPVeQAM,No full time doctor
a2p1U000000RqRrQAK,0011U00000rjtwQQAQ,It is easy to set an appointment and I think the Doctor is thorough in his assessments.
a2p3g000000L0SIAA0,0011U00000rjZgLQAU,Everyone was super nice and they didn't even mention anything to me about being 15 minutes late haha.
a2p1U000000Rq6TQAS,0011U00000ribkZQAQ,Dr. Davidson will take all the time needed to talk with you to find out what is wrong then put a plan together to correct it. Never had a doctor spend this much time with a patient. Usually appointments with other doctors are no more than 10 to 15 min. in and out as fast as they can and they will only address one issue per visit. Dr. Davidson addressees every concern and no co-pay.
a2p1U000000RpkUQAS,0011U00000riSvEQAU,Only went there for wellness check
a2p3g000000q4aeAAA,0011U00000rk0F9QAI,Good healthcare that is convenient and comfortable
a2p1U000000Rq9WQAS,0011U00000rhzPdQAI,It feels like it's a starting point for new doctors.  I'm not confident in their treatments.
a2p1U000000RqGiQAK,0011U00000riGN8QAM,Convenience and no cost
a2p1U000000RpLwQAK,0011U00000sgyU2QAI,Previous visits with my children.
a2p3g000000qC3TAAU,0013g000007PfNTAA0,I like the atmosphere and attitude of physician
a2p1U000000RvE1QAK,0011U00000rj6YsQAI,not a 10 because I have only had one visit but I was very pleased with the care and concern taken and given in that one appt.
a2p3g000000pui8AAA,0011U00000riozqQAA,easy appointment with my doctor.
a2p3g000000ptWaAAI,0011U00000rk1sJQAQ,"Dr. Hathaway, Kim and Oneisha and Rochelle are all helpful and kind. Rochelle always said ""...you can always call us. we are here for you"". Dr. Hathaway will do her best to take care of you. She is a good listener."
a2p3g000000qA8RAAU,0011U000019xyWUQAY,All in All it was OK
a2p1U000000RohBQAS,0011U00000rieIHQAY,"Knowledgeable staff, thorough and caring"
a2p3g000000q5TyAAI,0013g000003onROAAY,I feel like my doctor doesn't really listen to what I say.  I am struggling to get on the right medication and I just get referred to a therapist when I have already seen several in my past.
a2p1U000000Rsz0QAC,0011U00000rizTdQAI,This was my first visit. Dr. Ritter seems to be wonderful. The  downside of it the office is just a little far to drive to.
a2p1U000000RsoYQAS,0011U00000rihrdQAA,because it is convenient and doctors know by name and truly know you and the family.
a2p1U000000Rq2LQAS,0011U00000rjpeYQAQ,"I've been coming here for years and I love the place. The problem lies in the new receptionist. Chris was awesome. Sarah was great and greets me with a smile. The new person is texting on her phone all day. She doesn't greet me nicely. I fact, I feel like I'm the one inconveniencing her by being there. I once stood at the front of the desk for a minute or two while she texted someone. Only when I made some noise did she notice me. I LOVE the rest of the staff but this lady needs training."
a2p1U000000RqGFQA0,0011U00000rj2mJQAQ,"Caring and thorough physicians, easy to make appointments"
a2p1U000000RpsCQAS,0011U00000riLXGQA2,Most recent visit a doctor that is no longer with XYZ had in my records that I had foot surgery. Hopefully this is an isolated incident as that information is not accurate.
a2p1U000000RtDDQA0,0011U00000riKrvQAE,The lady working the front desk was not friendly at all.  (She had dark hair).  She talked but did not look at me the entire time.  She was not that busy.
a2p1U000000Rq8QQAS,0011U00000rj9hWQAQ,.
a2p1U000000RspUQAS,0011U00000riEIRQA2,Doctors and staff are friendly and it is easy to schedule an appt.
a2p1U000000RusFQAS,0011U00000rjcrzQAA,Because i was able to get into the dr the same  day i called and because he listened to what i had to say.
a2p1U000000Rpb5QAC,0011U00000rk5LjQAI,"My annual check up is always great, but when I am sick, it is next to impossible to get in to see someone."
a2p4w000002O3rqAAC,0014w000031qfjWAAQ,I feel like I get the bare minimum of help.
a2p1U000000RsrLQAS,0011U00000rjEbQQAU,She and her office staff were very friendly and responsive
a2p1U000000RqXMQA0,0011U00000rjrtCQAQ,The staff is very welcoming and courteous.
a2p1U000000RsZdQAK,0011U00000rk6iBQAQ,"Made an appointment 1 hour before seeing doctor, friendly staff, thorough examination."
a2p3g000000oeWpAAI,0011U00000rjXPpQAM,Not something I do.
a2p1U000000Row3QAC,0011U00000rjI0eQAE,"My Appointment was scheduled at 9 am and I received an email confirmation with that time on it.  When I arrived to my apt at 8:40 am I was told my apt was at 8 and would not be able to be seen.  After my pleading they did see me.  I did return to my office and reviewed the email confirmation again, and it clearly states my apt was at 9 am."
a2p1U000000RonwQAC,0011U00000rjr1bQAA,Convenient to office and quick
a2p1U000000Rsk1QAC,0011U00000ric9lQAA,"I like the concept, and I've already talked with several people."
a2p3g000000oReoAAE,0011U00001BfUB3QAN,"The process of scheduling and the online portal were fine.  The NB office does not have many physicians to choose from.  My appt. was for the biometric and get established as a patient.  The biometric was not as thorough as it has been in the past.  The other portion of the visit was very detailed about family history and my history and she checked my heart, that is it.  I was not asked about concerns I had of my health or well being.  I feel like the visit could have addressed concerns I had. The visit was too in depth with history rather than current health."
a2p3g000000oRluAAE,0013g000006tedNAAQ,I'm too new to do a 10 but so far so good
a2p1U000000RsSLQA0,0011U00000rjX9jQAE,The office I went to was new and I didn't feel super confident of either the receptionist/nurse or doctor.
a2p1U000000Rt5RQAS,0011U00000riJ48QAE,let me see doctor as a walk in.  was really sick and needed to be seen
a2p1U000000RptoQAC,0011U00000riSFlQAM,I like that it is next door and so easy to get in.  I also like Dr. McCay and the time he took with me to talk about my problem.
a2p3g000000oeVHAAY,0011U00000rjUmhQAE,fast good service
a2p1U000000RpKPQA0,0011U00000rhwOrQAI,"The ease of scheduling. And I was impressed with  the way Dr. Fury was available, direct and able to respond and explain things in a direct yet validating appriach."
a2p1U000000RoPOQA0,0011U00000rjcITQAY,"There are no office visit copays, prescriptions are reasonably priced, and friendly staff."
a2p4w000002O3ohAAC,0014w000031fxWYAAY,They need to organize the annual physical for a one day program to avoid members from losing multiple days of work.
a2p1U000000RsVCQA0,0011U00000rkCQiQAM,Service was very good
a2p1U000000RpwsQAC,0011U00000rii5dQAA,Good experience in the clinic.  Easy check-in process.
a2p1U000000RpG2QAK,0011U00000rk2XtQAI,I love how easy it is to get in to see the doctor the same day for appointments and responses to questions as well as picking up my medications while there so I don't have to make a trip to the pharmacy and wait for prescriptions to be filled.
a2p1U000000RqDrQAK,0011U00000rk2XtQAI,Fast same day appointments.  Dr. Malfese always takes time to listen to me.
a2p3g000000KysAAAS,0011U000011En8fQAC,"I have really liked every interaction that I have had with XYZ, however some of the things that were promised in the information meetings were not really true. We were told that there would be no charge for labs and that you would get your prescriptions filled for free.  There are only certain labs that are free and I got charged for the other labs.  I had labs drawn earlier in the year with the same insurance through lab core directly and it cost me nothing. So XYZ actually cost me more. I asked about the prescriptions and was told that they have some medications but they only give out a starter dose on new prescriptions they order. We were told in the meetings that we would not need referrals to other specialties because the physicians at XYZ can do those consults themselves- that is not true.  I experienced a delay in care caused by them not having access to the SSM EHR.  If this is the SSM Direct Care provider they should have access to the EHR and get notifications of results . Chest xray done on a Thursday at SSM - ready the same day.  I had to call XYZ because I had not heard anything on Monday and they had to call SSM.  Seems that there should have been better follow through on this."
a2p4w000002K1bnAAC,0011U00000rirhgQAA,"Everyone is very nice, but sometimes things seem a little rushed."
a2p4w000002JxSrAAK,0013g0000094p5dAAA,"I've had easy, satisfactory experiences."

a2p4w000002NzloAAC,0014w000031fxerAAA,You are new to us. So far so good.
a2p4w000002NyldAAC,0011U00000rk9bnQAA,Dr. Song-Nichols is fantastic but the scheduling system is very problematic.
a2p4w000002NylOAAS,0011U00000rj8ovQAA,"Because of your Bad Bad, Website Access portal"
a2p4w000002Nyz1AAC,0011U00000rjYrMQAU,The staff got me in at a last minutes notice and they were all beyond friendly.
a2p4w000002Nzb5AAC,0013g000007ZZLjAAO,Office Staff has no knowledge about basic Insurance questions or claims.  specially when having double medical coverage.
a2p4w000002Nyo3AAC,0011U00000rjUmeQAE,"Told the doc I had a sinus infection,  he said probably covid.... 
Then recommended the worst version of the vaccine , and finally requested antibiotics,  order was never placed,  and when it was fixed,  wasn't even sent to the right pharmacy,  seriously ??
That's my review , do better. 
This is the clinic at beer Capitol."
a2p4w000002NzpRAAS,0011U00000rjW4IQAU,"Great patient care, however there is little availability, it took me 2-3 weeks to get an appointment with my provider, often no appointments available for urgent concerns, and the receptionist will tell you to go to ""urgent care"" even though it's an issue that your PCP could resolve"
a2p4w000002KK2XAAW,0011U00000ricrGQAQ,Don’t usually talk health and do you still need to be a member
a2p4w000002NyjDAAS,0011U00000riKvjQAE,Ease of scheduling; time spent by physician with patient is much more than in a typical health care practice.
a2p4w000002KHgKAAW,0011U00000rkAXMQA2,Love Kim Spencer
a2p4w000002O0h4AAC,0014w00002pQCj3AAG,Was seen in a timely manor and treated professional for my needs
a2p4w000002NzxVAAS,0011U00000riXwZQAU,"There is little wait time to see the Dr when you arrive for your appointment.
The visit doesn't seem rushed.
All of the staff is very friendly."
a2p1U000000RptDQAS,0011U00000riXzCQAU,You guys are very accommodating to the patients needs. Not long waiting times to see the doctor.
a2p1U000000RoCzQAK,0011U00000ri4qRQAQ,My experience was very positive.
a2p3g000000KymcAAC,0011U00000riDhsQAE,Not totally happy with some aspects of the office
a2p1U000000RoxkQAC,0011U00000rhyVXQAY,I can't recommend XYZ unless the person has that insurance.
a2p3g000000LAdqAAG,0011U00000rhsj0QAA,Very flexible and convenient to make appointment.
a2p1U000000RolWQAS,0011U00000rjwT5QAI,I don't know many people who don't have XYZ.
a2p1U000000RvE6QAK,0011U00000riIG8QAM,Waited 51 minutes to see doctor before I walked out. I had a appointment and if they were overbooked I  should of been notified
a2p1U000000Rt65QAC,0011U00000rjrNfQAI,"Convenient, friendly and knowledgable doctors and nurses"
a2p3g000000pT7yAAE,0011U000019xycRQAQ,"1. the second interior door is very hard to open
2. the office is not clearly labeled and difficult to find
3. having my photo taken, after I showed a photo id seems offensive and untrusting
4. having to show my insurance card for an employer-sponsored, no charge to my insurance, seemed odd
5. having to complete a document about who to share results was unnecessary
6. results written on a post-in?"
a2p3g000000L02EAAS,0011U00000rjZcpQAE,"Easy to get appointments, staff is helpful, drs are skilled and easy to work with"
a2p1U000000Rt9RQAS,0011U00000rjL9GQAU,Time spent with patient is great!
a2p1U000000RpwRQAS,0011U00000ri8kbQAA,"It,s a great place and they really take care of you"
a2p1U000000RswfQAC,0011U00000rj2mMQAQ,"Firstly, could not figure out how to make an appointment. There was no messaging on the door as to hours, phone number, web address, nothing. Tried to search on HI! but got useleses search results. So finally just went down to the Tower location and asked how I could make an appointment. The desk girl seemed annoyed, but said she could help me. I said I was sick and needed to see someone. She gave some afternoon hours availability. I asked if there was anything sooner and she said 9:15. Stupidly, I took it. She asked me to come right back (8:45) with my ID and Ins card which I did, and got me processed in, then I waited. Was told I'd be seen right in just a few minutes at 9:20, and was ushered in at 9:30 - now missing a meeting with my boss. Processsing by the nurse was slow. I know he probalby thinks that by being slow it provides a sense of ""you matter to me"" but all it was screaming to me was - ""we're on my time now and I""m gonna take my time"". Then, had to wait for the doctor to get finished with another patient, normal but mind, this is now 30 minutes after the appoinment time and I'd now been there an hour. after 10 minutes, doc was available, but they couldn't get the audio to work (really?!?) and said I could either go down to the location where the doctor actually was, or come back later that afternoon ""which ever was conveneint"". well, as a sick person, who was very sick, and did not have time to be there or be sick, neither was ""convenient."" I would like to remind you that people like me, people who are 98% healthy and don't go to the doctor for every little sniffle, people who use these kinds of facilities all have one thing in common - we DON""T HAVE TIME. We don't have time to waste sitting in a waiting room, we don't have time to come back later. We just won't come back."
a2p1U000000RqaMQAS,0011U00000rjB7TQAU,On time- thorough- economical
a2p1U000000RpGOQA0,0011U00000rifp3QAA,They seem to care about your health and take the time to go thoroughly through your health history.
a2p3g000000qUORAA2,0011U00000rjWzLQAU,Very responsive medical staff.
a2p1U000000Rt7tQAC,0011U00000rjZfZQAU,My doctor took the time to address all of my concerns and seemed very efficient.  I was very comfortable talking with her and I never felt rushed.
a2p1U000000RqTyQAK,0011U00000ri3V3QAI,Good sevice
a2p1U000000RtCiQAK,0011U00000riZYXQA2,I have only had one visit and cant recommend on that
a2p4w000002NymMAAS,0014w000031g1i0AAA,"Convenience , and the cost."
a2p4w000002NzFOAA0,0011U00000rj2mJQAQ,I have always received great care from XYZ/XYZ. The providers are knowledgeable and always take time to get to know the patient and the issue they are coming to see them for. They are great at following up and making sure the issue is resolved.
a2p4w000002O0s7AAC,0013g000006tiweAAA,I didn’t feel like my thoughts were valued.
a2p4w000002O1dhAAC,0014w000031qdgJAAQ,They are professional knowledgeable and compassionate..
a2p4w000002O1HHAA0,0014w00002pPaQEAA0,"Thorough, professional, experienced"
a2p4w000002NznfAAC,0014w00002pQBo0AAG,"Not enough Dr's.
Was told in July it would take 5-6 weeks for apt.
My Dr their is gone.  Now I need to start over.  Staff rotations frequent.  I need to choose a new Dr almost every year.

NP's are not Dr's.
Did not like speeking with NP Nathan.  He spoke poorly of my past Dr there.
Then said they will no longer perscribe any narcotics because their bad.
Would not perscribe any medicine for my different conditions.
Only listed OTC medication to use.
Could get the same advise from a Dollar Store clerk in their medication isle.
Refused to perscribe narcodic pain medication even when nsaid long term use created sickness and possible damage.
Hard to get maintence drugs that have been on for decade such as for heart.

Problems scheduling & getting told I need to reschudle the day before apt.

Problems with perscriptions not called into pharmacy.  
Need to call back several times asking for them to submit my perscriptions.  
It takes between a business day to a week for perscriptions to be called in.
Sometimes not all perscribed meds get sent to pharmacy, requiring me to call back because the Dr said he was prescribing multible.

Takes many calls to get refurrals sent or copy of.  Stuck calling specialist, then the health clinic, then the specialist.  Back and forth for more than a week before it goes thru.  Insurance denied claim this year because referral was lost.  Took months to fix.

I get daily emails reminding me of appt and a call the day before to verify.
I got 1 call to verify the appt the morning before & confermed with them.
Then got a message at 5:30pm that I need to call back and conferm again for the same 8am apt.  Except calling back they were closed at 5.

Talking to others at work I hear the same complaints."

a2p3g000000LAbYAAW,0013g000006teqHAAQ,The Doctor Megan was very nice very attentive to your needs. The nurse was very good to.
a2p1U000000RsxlQAC,0011U00000rhw2xQAA,Dr was very knowledgeable and listened
a2p1U000000RsRUQA0,0011U00000sgyayQAA,Enjoyed the doctor as an initial impression.
a2p4w000002O4b0AAC,0013g000007ZZ2eAAG,"I only went once, don’t have enough experience to recommend or not."
a2p1U000000RqHMQA0,0011U00000riv1xQAA,"I did not like the doctor I saw.  He was condescending and made some assumptive remarks that offended me.  (I am not easily offended but when a healthcare professional doesnt take the time to get the right information through questions and then assumes the answer, that offends me.)  I will do everything in my power to NOT go back even though this is the most convenient location for me to see a doctor."
a2p1U000000RqAWQA0,0011U00000rjGTuQAM,"Good experience overall.  Easy to schedule, convenient office.  Dr McCay takes time, shows interest in my well-being and shares great detail."
a2p1U000000RvT6QAK,0011U00000riJ3VQAU,"I like the folks at XYZ and find them comfortable to work with so would recommend them to those looking for basic allopathic medicine. I personally prefer a more functional medicine approach, however, and usually refer folks to the FM folks that I know in the area."
a2p1U000000RuqSQAS,0011U00000sgxbcQAA,Easy to get hold of office and doctor. Decent service.
a2p3g000000LAdmAAG,0011U00000rjax2QAA,"Doctor tends to talk too much about things that are not relevant to my health.  Office visit could have taken half the time.  Understand that some patients may appreciate the extra time, but not me."
a2p1U000000RsaGQAS,0011U00000rjTgZQAU,I like the 24 hr availability
a2p1U000000RsabQAC,0011U00000rhu9DQAQ,attention to detail; taking time to explain concepts and information
a2p1U000000Rt0cQAC,0011U00000rhynUQAQ,"i was ill the next for days and she didnt recommend me to go home. also was unclear if it was a virus or allergies. I had this bug for 4 days. Luckily I was able to work from home for two days, i was contagious and got my trainer sick"

a2p1U000000Rt2aQAC,0011U00000riAHpQAM,I think the level of care you receive is good. The doctor really listens to your concerns and issues and is there to help.
a2p1U000000RqIdQAK,0011U00000rjaiyQAA,I personally just don't do referrals.
a2p1U000000RpZsQAK,0011U00000rjXQAQA2,"Problem with unprofessionalism at HWC by one person of Pal. staff/website problems/ slow response after leaving 3 messages, 1 email/ had to redo my account over as portal did not work"
a2p1U000000RsZmQAK,0011U00000rjPg8QAE,Both were friendly and helpful. It was different from most doctor appointments I've had since it was quiet with little commotion going on.
a2p3g000000KzLZAA0,0011U000011EnTEQA0,"It is easy for times when you're sick, because it takes months to get into my PCP, but my first experience was during the Covid-19 outbreak, so I don't have a fair assessment. I wasn't able to be physically examined at the clinic due to the symptoms that I was exhibiting; I was required to do a phone consultation, and then I came in for a flu swan. I was never actually physically evaluated."
a2p1U000000Roz5QAC,0011U00000rj0xhQAA,Knowledgeable easy to talk to staff.
a2p1U000000RpS2QAK,0011U00000rjZKZQA2,Easy to access

a2p1U000000RoEjQAK,0011U00000rilBOQAY,Always very nice and helpful
a2p1U000000RtLiQAK,0011U00000rk2EtQAI,"Quality care, no wait, Drs. take time if you need it.  I saw Dr. Brone this time but will see Dr. Hernandez as closer next time."
a2p1U000000Roq1QAC,0011U00000rjesHQAQ,"It works for minor health issues.   I cannot always get an appt when I'm sick, they want to schedule 3 days out??"
a2p1U000000Rpt0QAC,0011U00000rht1MQAQ,"Was not greeted at the waiting area. Doctor had poor social interactions/bedside manner. Was unsure what to do when leaving appointment as there was no one at the desk again, so I just left the office."
a2p1U000000RvYwQAK,0011U00000rhzRcQAI,"The Doctor's staff have been very difficult to work with in terms of returning calls, calling in prescriptions and eye rolling when asked about these things. The Office manager even argued with me, insisting my  type 1 diabetes was type 2  (i've been diabetic for 40+ years.)"
a2p1U000000RqJcQAK,0011U00000rjIciQAE,the doctor seems to have to many patients.
a2p1U000000RqLvQAK,0011U00000riMqvQAE,The doctor spent the time to speak to me about all of my concerns and did not rush me through.
a2p1U000000RtFHQA0,0011U00000rk5tWQAQ,Disorganized during my visit.  Dr.'s computer wasn't working.
a2p1U000000Rp0jQAC,0011U00000ri3UlQAI,I enjoyed the service and the friendliness of the staff
a2p1U000000RqGnQAK,0011U00000rjtSsQAI,My coworkers should know about XYZ Health.
a2p1U000000RpG5QAK,0011U00000rjSxaQAE,Take time to cover my health history and issues.  Don't feel rushed in physical.
a2p3g000000KzHuAAK,0011U00000rjdTiQAI,The Dr. did not listen to me at all.  He didn't check my back at all and was more concerned that I talk oxy 3 times a day while waiting for my surgery.  He advised me to take Advil even after I was told by my surgeon not to take it due to my up coming surgery.  When I advised him of this he told me it would be fine and would be out of my system in 24 hours.  I returned to the. ER afTer seeing him and the ER Dr stated he was extremely disappointed in my pcp as he didn't even look at me.  After he took the time to look at my back and feel around I was advised the mussels in my back is having spasms.  I was given medication that is ok to take before surgery and a referral was sent to physical therapy.
a2p1U000000l8GhQAI,0011U00000rjGfwQAE,MD spent quality time with me. listened to my complaints very carefully
a2p1U000000RqHQQA0,0011U00000ri0JDQAY,nursing staff and doctor was very nice and gave options and information for better health!
a2p1U000000RpnuQAC,0011U00000rjaiyQAA,I would only recommend if they worked downtown.
a2p1U000000RpD2QAK,0011U00000riAl7QAE,Doctor did not react appropriately to the issue I was having. Did not prescribe anti-viral medication.
a2p1U000000Rt8aQAC,0011U00000rj9hTQAQ,"Nurse and doctor are nice to work with and are professional.  But the service is expensive to the company which take the money out of the bonus pool, therefore I get a smaller bonus in December."
a2p1U000000Rso6QAC,0011U00000riUrZQAU,I like the personal relationship that Dr. Snyder wants to establish.
a2p1U000000Rt4TQAS,0011U00000ri16zQAA,"I had an annual physical on 10/13 which went ok.  Dr. Hernandez wanted some blood work, so while I was in the office they scheduled a blood draw on 10/18.  I showed up on 10/18 at 8:30 and the office was dark.  I sat for about 10 minutes thinking that they might have been late.  I left and called XYZ and found out that they were not working on 10/18.  Why would they have scheduled me on a day that they were gong to be out.  In addition, there was no sign on the door, saying that they were closed.  On 10/24 I was called by the Arvada office and told that I should come in again for a pap smear.  Apparently when I had the pap done on 10/13, they used a tube that was expired and the lab would not process the pap.  So I have to go in again for a test that is not very pleasant.  Wouldn't staff look for an expiration date on a tube before they use it?  Needless to say I am NOT HAPPY with my past visits and based on that would not recommend XYZ."
a2p1U000000RslhQAC,0011U00000ri16zQAA,Appt was similar to what u would receive elsewhaere
a2p4w000002KKYEAA4,0013g000006tfNSAAY,The doctors are very helpful when we are in office or have an appointment.  The use of the portal and scheduling appointments or getting a hold of my family's doctors is VERY difficult. We've been waiting to hear back from my daughter's doctor for weeks to no avail.
a2p4w000002O2XVAA0,0011U00000riuN4QAI,Love the phone appointments & the ability to get an appointment soon but the messaging system sometime takes too long to get a reply
a2p4w000002KK94AAG,0011U00000rjnfcQAA,"There is no medical doctor on staff. I was seen by a nurse practitioner who did not have the training, skill, experience or temperament to effectively provide top notch health care"
a2p4w000002O1WgAAK,0014w00002pQD1XAAW,Nurse practitioner good/ support staff fair
a2p4w000002NyMJAA0,0011U00000rjzOOQAY,Easy scheduling and great patient care
a2p4w000002NyYAAA0,0011U00000rk1QyQAI,feels more personal rather than feeling like an assembly line
a2p4w000002NygxAAC,0011U00000rillfQAA,You guys are fine.  People have been friendly. There is no waiting and my visit is much longer and complete than with other doctors.  This is valuable to me. I can only compare you to my doctor of 30 years....he is still great but cannot spend as much time with me and though his office was once homey the staff turnover makes me feel like a stranger.  Even though I barely come in I don't feel this at all with you.
a2p4w000002O1GTAA0,0014w00002pPaw4AAC,WCEMC has to be used
a2p4w000002O1AuAAK,0011U00000rigVcQAI,access to Dr's usually in a timely manner.
a2p4w000002O1hZAAS,0014w00002pPaPEAA0,The PA was great but after my issue with my TB test I am still not at the point that I would recommend this 100%
a2p4w000002O3OeAAK,0014w00002pQNcxAAG,This appointment was the exception to normally good service.  I felt my health concern was not properly addressed.
a2p4w000002O1RMAA0,0014w000031g286AAA,Free
a2p4w000002O1QiAAK,0014w00002pQBkRAAW,Very convenient for me & my family
a2p4w000002KKWwAAO,0011U00000rizBHQAY,No money out of pocket (yet).
a2p4w000002KKQtAAO,0011U00000rk4B7QAI,I was sick and had trouble getting an in-person appointment due to having a cough.  The doctor seemed more concerned about getting sick from me than he did about treating me.
a2p1U000000RpYQQA0,0011U00000rjA10QAE,Convience
a2p1U000000RoWMQA0,0011U00000rjvTDQAY,My doctor Kim Spencer is very personable and diligent about my health. She answers any questions I have with clear concise information. She assists me with making choices concerning my health.
a2p3g000000KzEFAA0,0011U00000rjt7NQAQ,Dr. Carter always takes her time with me and I never feel rushed.

a2p1U000000RoikQAC,0011U00000ri550QAA,"No copay, ample time with doctor."
a2p1U000000Rt9eQAC,0011U00000riosGQAQ,"In not a follower of eastern medicine, which is what she suggested. So, I tried it several times with no real success. I had a back injury back in the mid 90's. It flares up around once a year. Usually I can manage it with lots of Advil. But every few years or so, it flares up to the point where it's hard for me to function for around two weeks. I do understand that there is a painkiller abuse at epidemic levels. But there are plenty of patients where it's the best temporary treatment for short periods of time. This time my flare up was pretty bad and needed something stronger to treat my pain for about a week or so. The doctor that I saw apparently didn't believe me and I left the doctor no better than I was. Keep in mind that these visits aren't free. I suppose she never believes that a patient is always truthful about their level of pain and refuses to treat accordingly. And for that, I may never visit her office again. And possibly XYZ again."
a2p1U000000RoljQAC,0011U00000rjKyYQAU,I will explain how important it is to take advantage of the health benefits that our job offers.
a2p1U000000RpItQAK,0011U00000rj2jfQAA,It's very affordable and convenient
a2p1U000000RvAnQAK,0011U00000riyGXQAY,Really liked the doctor but the gentleman who drew blood couldn't do it and forgot my tetanus shot  but I did get that before I left though. Went to lab Corp and did Get samples taken though

a2p1U000000RtL0QAK,0011U00000riCQQQA2,"Because the hours are ""less than Perfect"" There are only a handful of Doctors in the program, We can't keep doctors that we like and those that are staying aren't taking new patients.."

a2p4w000002O3trAAC,0014w000031s7DmAAI,"The dr.  LISTENED, paid attention to details, didn't look at us or treat us like we were crazy,  he explained things, came up with a plan & showed us that he does care about his patients."
a2p1U000000RoA7QAK,0011U00000rjVu8QAE,"After several visits of not treating my disorder appropriately including the classic statement of ""come back to see me if no improvement"", I lost confidence in this doctor."
a2p1U000000RswyQAC,0011U00000rigkRQAQ,the time commitment required to complete a visit is too long.  You are not efficient in moving patients in and out.
a2p1U000000RsWkQAK,0011U00000rjq1QQAQ,The program is still in a state of flux.
a2p3g000000L0SGAA0,0011U00000ri2f1QAA,"Because you do not feel rushed during your visits, you feel that you are being heard."

a2p1U000000RuwNQAS,0011U00000rhtBjQAI,The cost for insurance at Seven Counties is extremely high. Being able to see a doctor without having to make a co-pay and pay extremely high prices for benefits helps.

a2p1U000000RsUNQA0,0011U00000rjZgAQAU,They seemed unsure that I had an appointment after resceduling me.  Then the nurse asked me questions she claimed were not in my chart but I could see the records with the answer.  I did not feel the room was private and the nurse kept telling me to whisper my information instead of speaking in a normal voice.  I prefer to use my primary care doctor who I have used for 20 years.
a2p1U000000RsQnQAK,0011U00000riYcEQAU,Like having the more personal approach
a2p1U000000RurqQAC,0011U00000rjXp5QAE,Was quick with no waiting

a2p1U000000RqdLQAS,0011U00000sh1MHQAY,"Please understand I'm writing this while I'm in a great deal of pain.  I remember Dr. Lee telling me I should have done every day activities instead of staying home because of my back.  Did she not hear me when I said I am in pain. Even now, when my pain is less I still cannot concentrate fully on my job.  Naproxin and tylenol DOES NOT help the pain.  I understand she doesn't know me and she  sees fat black crazy woman--but that still does not mean my pain is real.  This pain is second only to dry socket."
a2p1U000000l8C6QAI,0011U00000rkBTwQAM,"Nice people, but far away."
a2p4w000002KKXLAA4,0014w00002pPZn3AAG,"Weld County maintained a clinic run by Sunset, I believe.  When calling for an appt before 9AM the clinic would ALWAYS have a appt available that day.

Now that XYZ is running the clinic...
Calling for an appt before 9AM resulted in only a ""tele-visit"", not in person.
The ""tele-visit"" app and program were not functioning for the office...
End result of the appt ""You should go to urgent care""."
a2p3g000000L2xNAAS,0011U00000rjIhkQAE,Only can recommend to co-workers I don't think it is available to the public.

a2p4w000002NyFhAAK,0013g000007P1y1AAC,They were fast and efficient.  Answered my questions.  The facility itself is great but the location is not great for parking.
a2p4w000002O353AAC,0014w00002pPaRwAAK,"I felt like I got little medical advice  for what I came in for. I told the doctor by pain was 10 out of 10. I got no pain management plan or medication. I was told to go get an X-RAY. Now I have been trying to get an MRI, which was also requested by the doctor, however UC Health just keeps saying that the notes have not been sent with the order and I can't get an appointment. Meantime I had to have a phone meeting with the doctor to stress the level of pain I'm under and it's hard to walk or go to work. I was given a pain medication that I can't take at work, which helps with the pain on off hours, but no immediate plan for pain management for the immediate future. I've had to miss work because of the pain and apply for FMLA in order to be able to take the time off to figure out what is going on with my knee. It seems I can never get an in person appointment because you keep your doctors at different locations on different days. When you see one doctor you hope you can see the same doctor again, but not two or three weeks later!
I've been trying to use your automated system to make an appointment and it just keeps spinning and spinning and not confirming my appointment. 
When people are in pain they need immediate assistance not have to drag it out over two or three weeks because of the lack of available medical care providers in our area!"
a2p3g000000KzIqAAK,0011U00000rk100QAA,Convenient and very friendly professional environment.
a2p4w000002KKixAAG,0013g000002vOb2AAE,"easy to make appointments, quiet office with easy access, not crowded with people, friendly staff"
a2p4w000002O2TYAA0,0011U00000ri8kIQAQ,I like that you can see any of the doctors.
a2p4w000002O3DWAA0,0014w000031qbksAAA,They care and listen to you
a2p1U000000RpaMQAS,0011U00000riFWVQA2,i like the convenience of the location close to work. I walk to work and I can walk to the doctor's office. I was very happy with Dr. Snyder and am so far happy with Dr. Bernardi.
a2p1U000000RojbQAC,0011U00000ri84aQAA,Doctors and staff are friendly and knowlegable
a2p1U000000RqDdQAK,0011U00000rifF3QAI,XYZ makes it very east to schedule appointment and most care is done right in the office which makes it very convenient.
a2p1U000000RqenQAC,0011U00000ri0JqQAI,"friendly staff, comfortable setting, personal attention from physician"
a2p1U000000RssMQAS,0011U00000rjg3pQAA,"Nice facility, caregivers, but wait time has been too long."

a2p1U000000RqgUQAS,0011U00000riKbRQAU,"I receive a lot of information in how to manage my health. Stating and issue and i receive very detail information. Cares for their patient and is a listener (Dr. Cameron). I had an issue for the longest time, i stated the issue to Dr.Cameron and he knew exactly what i needed, which to this day I am now getting better in health."
a2p1U000000RqLjQAK,0011U00000rjKytQAE,The clinic is conveniently located in the building I work in and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
a2p1U000000Rt7rQAC,0011U00000riEfaQAE,well when I or others that I did recommend to you tried to call and make an appointment they never get to talk to a person they call several times to only get an answering machine and leave a message that is never returned
a2p1U000000RpevQAC,0011U00000riPVTQA2,Tried to make an appointment online and it would not supply me with the options under appointments only the ability to review appointments. I called the phone number to try to make appointment multiple times and no one answered the phone. Just showed up and then at that time given an appointment and I had to wait 30 min. Other than that it was a good visit.
a2p1U000000RtKIQA0,0011U00000riO5WQAU,Not very professional
a2p1U000000Rt06QAC,0011U00000riY1SQAU,"Friendly staff, clean facility, and close to work."

a2p1U000000Rp2qQAC,0011U00000rj27RQAQ,Quick appointments and friendly service
a2p1U000000RsnVQAS,0011U00000rhxZ6QAI,"Well, it's a free checkup, which I probably wouldn't do on a regular basis if it weren't for XYZ."
a2p1U000000RopRQAS,0011U00000ri2YEQAY,I haven't been connected with XYZ long enough to give a higher/lower rating.
a2p3g000000KyrZAAS,0011U00000rk1ohQAA,"Pros: low $, easy to make an appt, nice staff Cons: too much turnover, can't hardly see someone more than once before they leave the location"
a2p3g000000KzHZAA0,0011U00000ri1tjQAA,"XYZ is great, but a lot of my friends have insurance that would not cover it (otherwise, my rating would be a 10)."
a2p1U000000RsxYQAS,0011U00000riGtAQAU,I trust them for the basics and everyone is very nice and knowledgable.
a2p1U000000Rog8QAC,0011U00000riGGzQAM,Intimate atmosphere
a2p1U000000Rp6xQAC,0011U00000rjh6PQAQ,Clinic only open weird hours.  I tried to call multiple times and there's no answer.  No one gets back to me.
a2p1U000000Rt2kQAC,0011U00000ricINQAY,Not very flexible

a2p1U000000Rt1OQAS,0011U00000ri6HWQAY,Cause it was quick and easy
a2p3g000000KymqAAC,0011U00000rj8osQAA,"The doctor does not follow up with labs and imaging, doesn't review charts, and does not listen to issues."
a2p1U000000RsV4QAK,0011U00000rj6cyQAA,until i have been satisfied with this concept. i am reluctant to suggest fully.
a2p1U000000RsfhQAC,0011U00000rjpFiQAI,Sometimes the atmosphere is just a little too casual for a health clinic.
a2p1U000000RsWLQA0,0011U00000rk2CWQAY,There is a disease management program that correlates directly to our insurance costs. Participate and you pay 50% less. I do not like the fact that our personal Dr is linked to this.
a2p1U000000RqJ1QAK,0011U00000riu8ZQAQ,I'm like the approach of my personal physician but do have some concerns with tests ordered by my doctor not being done.
a2p3g000000KztWAAS,0011U00000rikoLQAQ,No comment
a2p1U000000RsYCQA0,0011U00000riOAsQAM,Great concern and respect

a2p1U000000RoKwQAK,0011U00000rj7oSQAQ,Close to where I live. I can walk to office.
a2p1U000000RsVlQAK,0011U00000sgzHKQAY,I feel like it is more of a personal approach to your health

a2p1U000000RotOQAS,0011U00000rioEDQAY,Great customer service
a2p4w000002O4fMAAS,0011U00000rjhxlQAA,quick appointments and knowledgeable staff

a2p3g000000KyqNAAS,0011U00000rjtScQAI,Easy to get appointments and convenient to have the blood draw on site.
a2p1U000000Rt5DQAS,0011U00000riOYRQA2,I felt that my interaction with my physician was more confrontational than collaborative.
a2p4w000002O42UAAS,0011U00000rhv8rQAA,friendly
a2p4w000002O4WKAA0,0011U00000rjUBaQAM,great doctors

a2p3g000000KzLlAAK,0011U0000125JnuQAE,everyone was very friendly and welcoming
a2p1U000000RovGQAS,0011U00000riBZBQA2,Don't really feel like I am heard by the Dr. My pain levels and anxiety levels are not being taken seriously. I feel I am wasting the Dr.'s time.
a2p1U000000Rp0TQAS,0011U00000rhq1iQAA,"Good, friendly service."
a2p1U000000RpBBQA0,0011U00000rjXz8QAE,Friendly and reasonably fast.
a2p1U000000Rp1iQAC,0011U00000rj5YSQAY,"convenient, but the revolving door of physicians is a big negative"
a2p1U000000RoWHQA0,0011U00000riuiBQAQ,"They don't seem to actively listen to what the problem is.  I have been to several providers with XYZ and will make every attempt to say why I don't like XYZ.  You  really dropped the ball here. I place no value in XYZ and will change providers next time I can as I have no faith in their healthcare, even if it costs more money.  I have brought up the same issue the last three times I have been in there and I have gotten the run-around.  I am done with XYZ and will make every effort to encourage my friends and family to not pursue them as a healthcare provider."
a2p1U000000RtNOQA0,0011U00000rjSMPQA2,I am comfortable with my doctor
a2p1U000000RoqNQAS,0011U00000riPVXQA2,It is easy and convenient for Humana employees.
a2p3g000000LAgLAAW,0011U00000rk9zgQAA,"Caring, proficient doctors, can treat many things"
a2p1U000000RsjjQAC,0011U00000rijPyQAI,"The overall experience was positive.  However, the blood draw was a bad experience - took three times to find a vein.  And I was supposed to hear back about my cholesterol results and never did :)"
a2p1U000000Rq20QAC,0011U00000riPTzQAM,"Time spent with patient is ideal, however, locations are not very convenient."
a2p1U000000RporQAC,0011U00000riFWVQA2,i've been generally happy with XYZ. primarily i like the office close to work. i was very happy w/ Dr. Snyder; i'm generally okay with Dr. Bernardy. but it seems office hours are spotty and undependable.
a2p1U000000Rt7DQAS,0011U00000riR0qQAE,Doctors are nice and receptionist is very friendly.
a2p1U000000RoMWQA0,0011U00000rilBOQAY,"Fast, courteous and friendly service  P"
a2p1U000000Rp5TQAS,0011U00000rjOXdQAM,"Convenience.  The doctor I have seems very good, and the staff is nice"
a2p1U000000RoMJQA0,0011U00000rjRj8QAE,I didn't like the doctor I saw.
a2p1U000000Ro7qQAC,0011U00000rj5mTQAQ,The front office is always very helpful in anything you may need.  Dr. Hernandez is very good at listening and willing to help you figure out what may be going on with your situation.
a2p4w000001pxpSAAQ,0011U00001BfUBkQAN,Called to talk about feelings of anxiety and treatment and doctor never even asked what was going on with me.
a2p4w000001ptXPAAY,0011U00000rilVIQAY,"Efficient, cost effective personal care."
a2p4w000001pqQVAAY,0011U00000rkAH2QAM,My doctor makes me feel like he really cares about me and my well being. The only draw back for my friends would be the distance from where we live to the office.
a2p4w000002K6A8AAK,0011U00000rjvnPQAQ,"Received txt messages that appointment was cancelled but was not.
Difficult to talk to someone when calling.
Tend to not return calls timely"
a2p4w000002K0cpAAC,0013g000004GwpOAAS,"I had a new nurse, I believe she is an NP and she was not as patient and seemed a little less concerned about my well being and more concerned about getting bloodwork"
a2p3g000000qTQbAAM,0013g000004GsEtAAK,You have always been accommodating and competent.
a2p4w000002K0kyAAC,0014w00002qmdLdAAI,I went there for appointment and because I had sore throat the made me have a phone visit.   I went there for my arthritis and couldn’t explain or show where pain was.  It was my first visit so it’s hard to talk to someone you have never met let alone try and explain things on a phone.  Plus I still have yet to hear from pharmacy that they sent my prescription to them.
a2p3g000000qpaDAAQ,0011U00000rk3mCQAQ,Easy to schedule appt. Plenty of time with Dr. Saves money.
a2p3g000000qpbVAAQ,0011U00000rkCBAQA2,"Convenient, and the doctor is awesome."
a2p3g000000qkotAAA,0011U0000125Jr3QAE,Easy to use
a2p4w000002K0egAAC,0011U00000rjW4IQAU,"Lack of follow through with the doctor. On multiple occasions the doctor tell me a plan to prescribe medication or refill medication and it doesn't happen. I've had to call to follow up with the prescriber because they forgot, and then they put in the order for the script. Additionally, providers have poor skills in explaining diagnosis and tx, and I almost always feel rushed and unsure of my plan for treatment, prognosis, or diagnosis."
a2p3g000000qmrkAAA,0011U00000riXwqQAE,Service was quick and easy to schedule.
a2p4w000002K1i5AAC,0011U00000riWK0QAM,"They take there time with you make you feel comfortable, anwser all your questions"
a2p3g000000qVQTAA2,0011U00000rjHv6QAE,"Service is very personable, I am very pleased with Dr. Omallia who is always very thorough in her examinations. Michelle is great, very friendly."
a2p3g000000qVNeAAM,0011U00000rjOJAQA2,Doctor cutter is a very pleasant Dr to deal with she seems to pay attention to your thoughts and tries to help figure out if you need the meds you need
a2p4w000002KAJ9AAO,0011U00000riBZEQA2,I like the plan and the concept is good.
a2p1U000000Rpm3QAC,0011U00000rjNbZQAU,no deductible for office visit

a2p1U000000RpnTQAS,0011U00000rhxPHQAY,The care is good. Cost effective
a2p1U000000RoK3QAK,0011U00000rjPx2QAE,I like XYZ but wish routine exams/physicals were more comprehensive.
a2p1U000000RtHoQAK,0011U00000ri9jSQAQ,Hard to figure out what times the office is open. Receptionist is not pro-active. Booking appointments on line is convenient unless more time is needed than it is almost a waste of time as you have to go back for another appointment.
a2p1U000000RskjQAC,0011U00000rjrb5QAA,I like the model of seeing one dr and being able to get in same day that you call.
a2p3g000000oRWpAAM,0011U00000rjJyiQAE,"I've never been pressured for time, as long as I'm talking they're listening."
a2p1U000000RtLKQA0,0011U00000riwv4QAA,"My appointment was at 8:00 a.m., the doctor did not actually show up to the clinic and into the exam room until 8:45 a.m. While I do understand and have experienced the known fact that doctors even though have a schedule can't always be in the exam room right on schedule, but to not actually show up to the actual clinic that I can say I've never experienced.  I was not given the opportunity to re-schedule my appointment, the receptionist never came to check in on me nor to let me know the doctor was running late-by the time he showed up I was extremely frustrated. The lack of professionalism and lack of concern for my time is just not acceptable in my book.  If the receptionist had said, listen, the doctor is running late would you like to reschedule-and let me decide if I want to stay and wait or reschedule-by far better.  I went in to renew a prescription for my inner ear problem and to get FMLA paper work filled out-it was getting ready to expire, the doctor used a marker which bled through he apologized, which was fine, I faxed the office a new one he stated he would get it to me that day (Friday).  I finally had to call Friday at 4:30, office is closed.  I called the Pueblo office, they stated no they are opened till 5-I explained I got the answering machine and that's what it stated.  She put me on hold, called the Canon office...got back on line with me and said the doctor would get it to me yet that evening.  I had to call back Tuesday because I hadn't received it,  spoke with receptionist and finally got it that afternoon.  So I send it to Risk Management for Department of Corrections (my employer) they explained that it was extremely vague and asked me to contact my doctor and ask that he change the wording.  They gave me wording from my last one-I called the office gave the receptionist the information.  Well, he sends me an email, doesn't call to discuss this, sends an email!  He closes his email to me ""if patient would like to discuss her concerns she can make an appointment.""  Are you kidding me?  I have the FMLA for job protection-I can tell you how much I used my FMLA last year--3 hours!  I am not asking for him to lie on this"
a2p3g000000oRYqAAM,0011U00000ritnjQAA,"No copays, long enough appt."
a2p1U000000RpNYQA0,0011U00000rjqqjQAA,Dr. Ritter and Laura go out of their way to help out whether it's fitting you in last minute or calling in a prescription promptly. Great bedside manner. Very friendly.
a2p3g000000Kyv2AAC,0011U00000riBoGQAU,I like the personal interaction with the doctor. I just feel constable going there
a2p1U000000RqQ9QAK,0011U00000ri9jPQAQ,"it was good service, to give it a 10 you would have had to buy me breakfast"
a2p1U000000l8JMQAY,0011U00000riXevQAE,convenient and was easy to make an appt.
a2p1U000000RoZMQA0,0011U00000rireXQAQ,Very friendly staff

a2p3g000000pO20AAE,0013g000009gjxKAAQ,"Personal care, no wait time at arrival."

a2p3g000000ouBmAAI,0011U00000sgyVfQAI,I enjoy not feeling rushed and having a medical team that cares.
a2p3g000000owJsAAI,0011U00000riYc0QAE,The first time I went I was very impressed. The doctor was very thorough and very attentive to everything. The 2nd time I went I felt like it was a complete waste of time. Two totally different experiences. Both were for physicals.
a2p3g000000qVWgAAM,0011U00000rjoKiQAI,"Well exam was completed with me being fully clothed (jeans, sweater)."
a2p3g000000pPYlAAM,0013g0000094XNyAAM,Very polite staff and clean offices
a2p3g000000pM1PAAU,0011U00000rjiGqQAI,covid test was quick and easy
a2p3g000000pwySAAQ,0013g000002vIfjAAE,Great concept but everything seems very disorganized

a2p3g000000oyHKAAY,0011U000019xyPhQAI,Was difficult to get a hold of people
a2p3g000000ozEqAAI,0011U00000rjYDKQA2,I thought the dr wasnt very helpful. I asked to be testes dor covid he said no need to because they aint accurate. And regardless go into quarantine for 2 weeks.
a2p3g000000owMQAAY,0011U000019xyXGQAY,Not the easiest to find. Was weird that there was no actual paperwork filled out. Just wrote information down on scratch paper
a2p3g000000p07cAAA,0011U00000rigVcQAI,based on experience
a2p3g000000prbnAAA,0011U00000rjLlvQAE,THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE DOCTOR SPENDS WITH THE PATIENT IS VERY VALUABLE AND APPRECIATED
a2p3g000000owL5AAI,0011U00000rjTgQQAU,"I usually think XYZ is ok but yesterday it took 6 calls to talk to someone, then dr forgot to call in my prescription."
a2p3g000000pdeEAAQ,0011U000019xyQqQAI,I already have a Primary Doctor.
a2p1U000000RpGnQAK,0011U00000rhxvwQAA,I selected 5 because Paladins health through insurance is at my wife's office.
a2p1U000000RpHRQA0,0011U00000ri41jQAA,"I have no complaints about XYZ.  The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I would not usually be inclined to recommend health services to anyone.  So they did a great job, but honestly I probably wouldn't recommend because I don't do that with something so personal."
a2p1U000000RoWYQA0,0011U00000rjHv8QAE,Convenient and personable.
a2p1U000000RqGvQAK,0011U00000riZNTQA2,I liked the time the doctor took with me. The staff was kind and friendly.

a2p1U000000RoBmQAK,0011U00000rjW74QAE,"I did not enjoy my visit with Dr. Johnson.  I made it clear when scheduling my appointment that I was interested in getting a referral for breast cancer genetic testing.  Nonetheless, she was totally unprepared for our appointment and was not knowledgeable about the testing.  She had no idea who to refer me to and ultimately I left the appointment having to find a place to do the testing.  I also did not appreciate her demeanor.  She was cold and uncaring regarding what is, for me, a stressful situation."
a2p1U000000Rp1zQAC,0011U00000riF02QAE,It was very convenient and free.
a2p3g000000LAbGAAW,0013g000002vOa8AAE,"I prefer holistic responses to """"illness"""" but was as pleased as I could have been given I have to work within a """"system"""" that feels administrative heavy."

a2p1U000000Rq6wQAC,0011U00000rk5dmQAA,Quick appts. Staff was nice.
a2p1U000000Rqg2QAC,0011U00000rk2a4QAA,"Aside from the location being very near by, Dr. Cameron not only addressed any concerns to my own health, but it was very nice to be able to get answers about my children as well, and not hae to make a sepreate appointment to discuss them.  Definatly went above any ohter physician I've ever had!"
a2p1U000000RqQeQAK,0011U00000rjVMZQA2,XYZ has the best health system in medicine today!

a2p1U000000l8LdQAI,0011U00000rjW4IQAU,"At the last visit, the doctor was very unprofessional. I felt rushed, and I didn't have enough time to tell her my concerns,. When I did attempt to tell her my concerns, she dismissed them. I drove 40 minutes to the appointment which only lasted 7 minutes as I was rushed out. I was not given the test I asked for, my temperature was not taken, and the doctor failed to take my heart rate and check on other symptoms. The doctor then concluded by stating that ""it's that time of year"" noting that illnesses were going around and that I would need to deal with it. Obviously, if I felt I could handle my symptoms I would not have felt the need to schedule an urgent same day appointment."
a2p1U000000Rp5kQAC,0011U00000riRf5QAE,"No waiting time, pleasant staff and doctor spent more time with me than I've experienced with doctors in the past."
a2p1U000000RsfPQAS,0011U00000rjCJGQA2,"I like Dr. Brone, but my husband's experience with Dr. Muse (sp?) has given us both concerns regarding the professionalism and consistency of the doctors."
a2p1U000000RpBGQA0,0011U00000rjCc1QAE,Love the more personalized care and time spent w Dr Wren! I felt that she listened and she cared!

a2p3g000000KzCOAA0,0011U00000ribkZQAQ,"The doctor will spend time with you. Instead of being pushed and hurried and only taking about one thing, he will take time to ask if there is any thing else. Great bed side manor."

a2p1U000000RsneQAC,0011U00000riCnaQAE,"XYZ is handy and free.  That part's great.  Dr. Shuherk tries very hard, and most of the time, is very helpful.  We were disappointed with this most recent contact.  Lindsay is 17.  She had been to Dr. Shuherk a week prior for strep.  This current contact was so that she could receive a school-mandated Varicella vaccine.  While there, Dr. Shuherk checked her strep, etc.  Computers were down.  They handed Lindsay a note scrawled on a blue envelope.  On the blue envelope was scrawled an address, and a time.  Apparently, Dr. Shuherk was sending her to see an ear, nose and throat specialist regarding some problem with her ear.  We do not even have a CLUE what the problem IS.  And there is no dr. name or phone number written on the blue envelope.  Although my husband was there with our daughter, Dr. Shuherk never said a single word to my husband.  No word about what was wrong, why he was sending her to another Dr, etc.  Also, Jasmine randomly made the appointment for Lindsay to see the ENT dr at 1:30 p.m. the next day, without consulting my husband.  Lindsay doesn't get out of school until 3, and cannot miss school.  We were very, VERY frustrated with the whole situation.  Since then, we have been waiting 2 days for Jasmine to call us back, since we cannot contact the ENT guy directly, because we do not know who he is, or what his phone number is!"
a2p1U000000RsxgQAC,0011U00000rjUiuQAE,Its convenient when I need to ssee a health practitioner while at work--but I can't see making a special effort to use
a2p1U000000RqTSQA0,0011U00000rjgfCQAQ,The dr was slow to respond to my inquiries and didn't seem very professional during appointment.
a2p1U000000RpW9QAK,0011U00000rjvnZQAQ,good care and great value
a2p1U000000RonOQAS,0011U00000rjYnmQAE,"They are always friendly and helpful, caring"

a2p1U000000l8DTQAY,0011U00000sgyvxQAA,my last visit was not as it usually is.  the environment has changed.
a2p1U000000RqJZQA0,0011U00000rjx6XQAQ,"I like that I  can get in quickly and that the doctors are so accessible.  I am begining to wonder, however, if I am not being referred to specialists in an effort to keep costs down for my employer."
a2p1U000000RoUiQAK,0011U00000ri6QrQAI,don't know enough. I had to phone several time to get a living breathing person. I absolutely hate press one for etc.

a2p1U000000l8JvQAI,0011U000011Em1rQAC,"After only one visit, it's hard to say whether I would recommend, but I had no complaints and the first visit was very thorough."
a2p1U000000RssIQAS,0011U00000rjvTDQAY,I like the atmosphere and the friendly care of the staff. I truly believe that any thing that concerns me healthwise is a concern for them too.
a2p1U000000l8CQQAY,0011U00000rjTTuQAM,The nurse made us feel very uncomfortable.  She had two of us in the room for a flu shot  and the person I was in the room with got violated by the nurse unzipping her blouse.  It got reported to Palidina and the nurse got talked to.  She is still there. How do we go there and have  her as our nurse now?!  It's like being victimized twice!
a2p1U000000RoTeQAK,0011U00000riK5lQAE,Friendly atmosphere
a2p3g000000oeW4AAI,0011U00000rjFX1QAM,Quick in and out

a2p3g000000qJqAAAU,0013g000007P1xUAAS,I generally do not speak about Healthcare to co-workers. (Especially now since I do not see my co-workers and rarely have small talk.)

a2p3g000000q5WTAAY,0011U00000rj3g8QAA,"I like the extra time our doctor spent with us.  It is also very convenient.  I would rate higher, but I have not had a chance to test it out beyond the introductory visit."
a2p1U000000RqUhQAK,0011U00000rjB4nQAE,"No lines, office is clean and has an optimistic feel to it.  Doctor has the time to spend with you.  There is a follow up process as well, such as this survey."

a2p1U000000RoxeQAC,0011U00000rhypPQAQ,The new female MD at the Monroe location is NOT a good match for the XYZ system.  She has horrific assessment and customer service skills.

a2p1U000000RpuLQAS,0011U00000rk9fSQAQ,"Love the easy times to get in without weeks of wait time. I like my Dr., he listens to what I have to say. The nurse staff is very efficient. I can get a lot of stuff done by 1 Dr. instead of all special Dr."

The tool used to measure height was clearly crooked, like not just a little bit. When the lady took my blood, she had gloves on but her pointer finger (the whole finger) was exposed and out of her glove somehow. I did not get screened for Covid questions before coming in."
a2p3g000000owPRAAY,0013g000006tgDBAAY,"Scheduling an appointment was easy, the doctor was very personable."

a2p1U000000Rp3GQAS,0011U00000rjJ9PQAU,They never informed me about my appointment and took to long to get back with my Lab results. I think that's the problem of this clinic I went to. My husband's doctor and clinic was good for those parts.

a2p1U000000RqVbQAK,0011U00000rjSMPQA2,"Felt forced to go to a XYZ doctor.  perfectly happy with my previous doctor, and he also gave a CDL physical.  But with the reduced cost to me, I had to go."

a2p1U000000RofjQAC,0011U00000rjgpRQAQ,"the staff and doctors seemed very helpful and informative, like what a family physicians office should feel like. The facility was warm and engaging. I felt comfortable there."
a2p1U000000RouGQAS,0011U00000rhxwEQAQ,"We were told by our employer that we could use the services of the doctor that was at the XYZ facility. At my last visit Im told that I should have gone to my primary care doctor instead of """"taking her away from her other patients""""....WTF is up with that?"
a2p1U000000Rsh6QAC,0011U00000rj1UmQAI,I like it thus far.  I believe most here have already attended a seminar reference this program.
a2p3g000000pO8XAAU,0013g000005H7LMAA0,"Great location, nice people!"
a2p1U000000RqfqQAC,0011U00000sh1NIQAY,"At every stage it seems like I have to go through extra work to get information. Originally in filled out a form that indicated my preference for being contacted. That is constantly ignored. Before I came to DaVita I had a doctor in Seattle and if I had routine blood work done he would just copy the results and maybe add a hand written note and mail it to me. With XYZ it is all very difficult to get simple information. I do not use a cell phone and I do not want to be called at work because it is not private. And XYZ wont send me information or leave it where I want it. The only way to get the information I want is to create a user profile with a web site. I'm not buying mp3 files. Whe does it have to be so complicated and overly regulated? I am seriously considering switching back to my doctor in Seattle, which would actually mean I would have to take more time off. But I think it would be easier."
a2p1U000000RvZ9QAK,0011U00000risW5QAI,Very friendly staff.
a2p3g000000owLmAAI,0011U00000rizTdQAI,Dr. Ritter is a wonderful doctor I just wish XYZ Health was associated with Aurora records would make it a lot easier for my other doctors to see everything.
a2p4w000002NysoAAC,0011U00000ri3V7QAI,Only town employees
a2p4w000002O1KQAA0,0014w000031qcfXAAQ,"I like the ppl at the clinic, they're nice!  They seem to be pretty good at what they do.  However, i've told them 3x that i need baby needles when doing blood draws, which go ignored.  I get poked and poked and poked.. and they get no blood.  I lose, the red cross told me that if a larger needle is used, it can cut my vein in half-i lose again.  Instead of listening to me, they continue to do the same thing on last visit.--
I also told them that i just had a blood draw after being poked, maybe they could use that information??  They continued to poke--unitl Ashley gave up as well.  Then i mentioned having a recent the blood draw again--they decided to use it at that point.  Summary, not everyone is the same (use small needles), had recent results already (listen ??)   .. I like them a lot, but maybe they feel they have to check everything over and over (from my perspective).. somewhat annoying to be poked so many times using wrong needles"
a2p4w000002O2WXAA0,0011U00000rhvSuQAI,"Friendly, convenient"
a2p4w000002NyzBAAS,0014w00002pPaNiAAK,"Both ladies that worked with me yesterday were wonderful.  However, the building was very hard to find."
a2p4w000002O0qkAAC,0014w000031qLhhAAE,One of the tests that was supposed to be performed from my blood work wasn’t done.
a2p4w000002O16EAAS,0011U00000rjoeMQAQ,The appointments can be made as early as same or next day. The service is excellent.
a2p4w000002O0yoAAC,0011U00000rillpQAA,"Great service, very friendly Doctor and Nurse"
a2p4w000002Nzy9AAC,0014w000031g0rtAAA,I only received an email to let me know of this appointment. I don’t check my email everyday.
a2p4w000002O1FLAA0,0014w00002pParTAAS,"Easy to schedule, convenient"
a2p4w000002NzTLAA0,0014w000031g1SVAAY,"Bianca, the lady i saw during my visit called me by the wrong name, misread my records that I brought in for her. She was very unprofessional and not very helpful."
a2p4w000002O0aIAAS,0014w00002pPaQqAAK,have only been once; can't really judge it on only one visit
a2p4w000002O0acAAC,0014w000031qbmZAAQ,"Good value, clear policies, competency,"
a2p4w000002O0arAAC,0013g00000HTLV8AAP,Friendly staff.
a2p4w000002O1YSAA0,0014w000031rCnHAAU,I thought my physical was minimal in nature. I have had physicals in the past that were much more informative and diagnostic.
a2p4w000002O2BZAA0,0011U0000125IggQAE,I am fortunate my husband's employer includes XYZ Health as an option.  None of my family or friends have the same option for health care.
a2p4w000002O0dRAAS,0011U00000rjYVPQA2,"The only reason I didn't rate XYZ a 10 is that I was given, what I consider to be, reckless medical advice by my physician in July. I was very sick with what symptomatically appeared to be COVID 19. In a telephone visit Dr. William Martin recommended and prescribed Ivermectin for me. Fortunately, I was skeptical and consulted with a physician friend and confirmed that Ivermectin has no proven use as a treatment for COVID 19. Additionally, Dr. Martin did not recommend monoclonal antibodies treatment, a proven and accepted treatment that was available at outpatient clinics in our area. In our conversation, Dr. Martin also disparaged our country's ""vaccine or bust mentality"". I was very disappointed in my care when I was quite sick. As it turned out, two negative COVID tests three days apart, indicated that my illness was not COVID. While I know that Dr. Martin has since retired, I feel that XYZ could do a much better job of vetting and training their physicians and following up on the care provided to patients."
a2p4w000002O2huAAC,0011U00000rk141QAA,Doctor is knowledgeable and friendly
a2p4w000002O08OAAS,0014w00002pQNVxAAO,You push the Covid vaccine but won’t provide a medical disclosure of what’s in it
a2p4w000002O0nWAAS,0014w000031qbkpAAA,Doctors
a2p4w000002O04qAAC,0011U00000rim4VQAQ,I want Dr. Morgan back
a2p4w000002O16sAAC,0014w00002pQM21AAG,"Physical assistants change every year or less. I have a Dr I have seen for 11 years, he knows me. Your Drs did not help me for 4 years."
a2p4w000002O1mtAAC,0014w00002pQ8YSAA0,There have been issues over last 2 months with my care…I am willing to keep an open mind only because of Dave Weston PA…he is incredible
a2p4w000002O0CGAA0,0014w00002pQGd8AAG,Because they are in the Union Family Healthcare Center
a2p1U000000RsTYQA0,0011U00000rk3npQAA,it's the staff. no matter what else is going on they make me feel like I'm the only thing happening
a2p1U000000RonEQAS,0011U00000ri4qRQAQ,Personal decision
a2p1U000000RqabQAC,0011U00000ri0iTQAQ,holistic approach
a2p1U000000Rpy0QAC,0011U00000rj280QAA,"Knowledgeable doctor, invites questions, friendly and efficient staff.  Prompt."
a2p3g000000oeTtAAI,0011U000019xyaTQAQ,"The place is dirty, there is unprofessional stuff at the front desk (trophy with a poop emoji hat, wtf), my partner and I were seen in the same room together (HIPAA still applies even if youâ€™re married). The door to our room was kept open until the tech was actually there to run the tests (why not closed for our privacy?). She measured our heights wrong (we checked when we got home). In general it was a very unprofessional experience that I will never be repeating if I can possibly help it."
a2p1U000000RtDWQA0,0011U00000ripXDQAY,I was able to get in relatively quickly and when I got their they took the time to understand what my issues were. They were then able to come up  with the best coarse of action to help me.
a2p1U000000RordQAC,0011U00000riGJsQAM,Efficiency
a2p1U000000RoOhQAK,0011U00000rhrBeQAI,"My first few visits were very good. However, after my last visit, I was prescribed another drug with side effects I DO NOT LIKE! . It seems that prescribing drugs and not offering other alternatives goes against the Hippocratic Oath. If this becomes the norm, I will be seeking other Medical Advice."
a2p1U000000RpasQAC,0011U00000riCS2QAM,love my doctor and she knows me and my family
a2p1U000000RscMQAS,0011U00000ri0eLQAQ,I feel the service level from the doctor has gone way down - no follow up and I feel I'm always chasing him down when I need lab results or RX filled.
a2p1U000000RoOFQA0,0011U00000rjm6DQAQ,Quick and convenient.
a2p1U000000Rpa3QAC,0011U00000riv1wQAA,This location is very convenient for me - I cannot say what would be convenient for someone else.
a2p1U000000RqLSQA0,0011U00000rj2mOQAQ,"getting an appointment is a nightmare.  I call and leave messages because people rarely pick up.  In the 8 times i've called over the past 2 weeks i've only had a person answer once.  I've left over 4 voicemails with my phone number and never receive a call back.  Other than that, everything was good."
a2p1U000000RqH9QAK,0011U00000rkAEgQAM,"It's fast, simple, easy, and convenient."
a2p1U000000RouXQAS,0011U00000riggQQAQ,It was nice not to be rushed during the appointment
a2p1U000000RssqQAC,0011U00000rjiGjQAI,"There was some confusion as to why I was there, but they eventually got it figured out.  Staff was very nice, and seemed knowledgeable."
a2p1U000000RokaQAC,0011U00000rjQLFQA2,I Iike the doctor
a2p1U000000RtJIQA0,0011U00000rjzyUQAQ,thorough service and listened to everything I had to say
a2p1U000000RuuGQAS,0011U00000rhxrfQAA,"Convenient, high quality"
a2p1U000000RsZ1QAK,0011U00000rjf9NQAQ,thorough exam and good advie
a2p1U000000RsXyQAK,0011U00000rj1CKQAY,"It is easy and the people are great,"
a2p1U000000RsVvQAK,0011U00000rjq1QQAQ,"Good concept, but still unproven. Already lost one doctor."
a2p1U000000RushQAC,0011U00000rhtZKQAY,Cuz my mommy is Dr. Roberts and she and Dr Muse ROCK!
a2p1U000000RoCtQAK,0011U00000rj9G7QAI,I've had both good and bad experiences.  The staff turn-over means I've never had a real dr/patient relationship with anyone there.
a2p1U000000RtJxQAK,0011U00000riGJsQAM,Quick and efficient
a2p1U000000RpgJQAS,0011U00000riCUVQA2,"The center is convenient, but not professional. There is clearly not enough staff to do administrative work. So when I call to make an appointment, no where ever calls back or answers the phone."
a2p1U000000RoBkQAK,0011U00000rjvUhQAI,I usually don't do that unless asked.
a2p1U000000RowIQAS,0011U00000rihr6QAA,XYZ goes by their word.
a2p1U000000RqIUQA0,0011U00000rhrvCQAQ,"I have had one appointment and I don't think that's enough to base a recommendation on, but it isn't enough to not recommend it, either."
a2p1U000000RuuJQAS,0011U00000riD7bQAE,"Easy, fast and friendly."
a2p1U000000RqHSQA0,0011U00000riOAwQAM,"The facility was warm and inviting, the nurses were very friendly. It was so convenient for me."
a2p1U000000Rt5kQAC,0011U00000riUE6QAM,x
a2p1U000000RpAJQA0,0011U00000rjG7VQAU,The doctor took time to attend to me and even gave me a good advice based on what am going through which is outside his scope. They were courteous and caring.
a2p1U000000RsydQAC,0011U00000rjcTxQAI,Great service and I enjoy not feeling rushed or waiting a long time to see the doctor. It's more personal.
a2p1U000000RpFZQA0,0011U00000riMCiQAM,"Although the facility was nice and professional, it took over a month to schedule a new patient appointment, a day before the appointment they called and had to reschedule it for another week later, and at a different location. This was definitely difficult to work with as your locations are also only open during usual business hours so it is required to get time off work to attend an appointment."
a2p1U000000RsoiQAC,0011U00000ricdmQAA,I had a great experience the first time.  Want to experience more before giving a 10.
a2p1U000000RqMPQA0,0011U00000rk5smQAA,"Cannot reach anyone at front desk after multiple calls, had to visit the clinic three times to have a script filled that was supposed to be filled four days earlier."
a2p1U000000RqgHQAS,0011U00000rjyWtQAI,"The MA did my initial assessment with me when I came in. When the doctor came in, she didn't read my chart, and ended up asking me all the same questions I just went through with the MA, plus I think some of the things I wanted to discuss with the doctor, I forgot to ask about the second time."
a2p1U000000RqAIQA0,0011U00000rjOJ9QAM,Doctor turnover; staff are friendly but felt a bit of a lack of professionalism
a2p1U000000RowbQAC,0011U00000riVX2QAM,Very nice people
a2p1U000000RoV1QAK,0011U00000rihYWQAY,Efficient operation. Knowledgeable staff. Able to get RX at appointment.
a2p1U000000RoANQA0,0011U00000rjyZmQAI,"My regular doctor was on vacation and was out. I need to see a doctor right away and was scheduled in a different location. However, when I actually meet the doctor, she was not the doctor I was scheduled with. Somehow I got a different doctor on the day of my appointment. Anyway, she was nice, but she lacks experience. Her knowledge was just enough to get by for my problem."
a2p1U000000RsYdQAK,0011U00000ritTfQAI,"Ease of use, mainly. The clinic location is good. The doctor(s) seem nice and professional."
a2p1U000000RosuQAC,0011U00000rk0FHQAY,"Easy to get an appointment, no co-pays, provider spends enough time with me and seems genuinely interested in my health and goals."
a2p1U000000RuwxQAC,0011U00000rjM7YQAU,"Seen right away.  Dr & staff knowledgeable, professional, and courteous."
a2p1U000000RovrQAC,0011U00000riwUmQAI,"Personalized service, fair costs, access to a doctor in a short time."
a2p1U000000RpamQAC,0011U00000rjROFQA2,"Fast,  easy, and very convenient. Personalized service."
a2p1U000000Rt6VQAS,0011U00000rjW9yQAE,Doctor does not seem to complete understanding health.
a2p1U000000Ro7DQAS,0011U00000riiwXQAQ,"Despite being located at my work, the wait is 10-20 minutes - after my appointment scheduled start time."
a2p1U000000RsyOQAS,0011U00000rizVjQAI,positive experience thus far
a2p3g000000KzBcAAK,0011U00000ri4oxQAA,Ease of making appts
a2p3g000000oeXMAAY,0011U00000rhvoDQAQ,Comfortable with my doctor and his staff
a2p1U000000RoRLQA0,0011U00000rhsaHQAQ,"quick, affordable, close to the office, and i've always liked my XYZ Dr.s"
a2p1U000000RshhQAC,0011U00000rjgXgQAI,I had a great experience with Dr. Muse. He was very helpful. He was patient and thorough in explaining the recommended treatment.
a2p1U000000RoFAQA0,0011U00000riYFtQAM,"Prompt service.  Dr. DeAllaume listens to me, doesn't spend the whole time on the computer, discusses options."
a2p1U000000Ro4eQAC,0011U00000rjMBuQAM,Appts. always available and easy to get in to see doc
a2p1U000000RpybQAC,0011U00000rjksRQAQ,Good doctor
a2p3g000000LAarAAG,0011U00000riNV8QAM,First Visit
a2p1U000000Roo4QAC,0011U00000rhvApQAI,I liked the small & friendly atmosphere of the office. I liked the time my providers devoted to spending with me. I appreciate that this is a part of my wellness/ insurance benefits at work.
a2p1U000000RqdOQAS,0011U00000sh1NIQAY,"It's a good choice in terms of no cost with Cigna/DaVita. Good, thorough time with Phyiscian. The taking of blood for labs was fumbled a couple of times. And apparently only the doctor knows how to leave an informative message on my phone."
a2p3g000000KyrBAAS,0011U00000rjJsoQAE,Because you don't take patients who don't work for the companies you service....this question makes no sense.
a2p1U000000Rv84QAC,0011U00000ripDOQAY,Always friendly and helpful staff very well organized
a2p4w000002Nzv5AAC,0014w00002pQ9ltAAC,Overall smooth and the wait wasn’t too long.
a2p4w000002KKmQAAW,0011U00000rjEbBQAU,"I think at my age, almost 62, it’s not a great fit. My issues tend to be very specific and not general. However, getting into see a doctor is very easy and if you need to start somewhere this is a good fit."
a2p4w000002KKpeAAG,0013g000006tj3dAAA,I have had no major issues with XYZ Health and appreciate my provider.
a2p4w000002O2gNAAS,0011U00000rjmK7QAI,Ease of access (on-site location). Nurse & Doctor are accommodating & resourceful.
a2p4w000002KKCXAA4,0011U00000rjxhaQAA,When I broke my leg last year you made me feel like a drug addict when asking for aid in pain management even though my knee was twice the size of the other. Then once finally prescribed I wasn't even given a prescription that was going to last me until my x-ray appt or thru the weekend. This was an awful experience and worse customer service.
a2p4w000002NyeDAAS,0011U00000rjwhUQAQ,Dr Friensen really cares and works with her patients to come to the best solution. She asks good questions and doesn't jump to conclusions.
a2p4w000002NyVaAAK,0014w00002pPaQhAAK,The service was done in a timely fashion. It was easy to speak with Doctor MIchelle and seemed genuine and concerned about my needs and suggesting helpful ways to stay in good health.
a2p4w000002O39PAAS,0011U00000riMUkQAM,"The small office is super friendly! The staffing of the office needs adjustment. The poor gal up front has to answer the phone, draw blood, and process client paperwork. She works hard and is apologetic about waiting but 2 people are needed to assist in all the duties."
a2p4w000002KKtRAAW,0011U00000rjFKZQA2,Staff not  good at drawing blood.
a2p4w000002O2g8AAC,0011U00000ri8zmQAA,My Doctor didn't realize that I had made a video appointment and I waited for 30 minutes without any indication of whether or not she would ever show up. I was able to connect after sending a message to her.
a2p4w000002O40TAAS,0014w000031qbqTAAQ,Great servicr
a2p4w000002NyJoAAK,0013g000006NuorAAC,I received immediate care when I was expecting to be given information on next steps. Very open to my asking questions and friendly.
a2p4w000002NyCdAAK,0014w00002pQGsjAAG,XYZ manages the practice provided by my employer
a2p4w000002KKOiAAO,0011U00000ricszQAA,Effecien/organized/personalization/employees and doctors listen and care
a2p4w000002O3XlAAK,0011U00000rhulIQAQ,I don’t often just talk about how good my doctor is. But I have always had good experiences here
a2p4w000002O1NyAAK,0011U00000rigVcQAI,"it is convenient , helpful, and fills a need!"
a2p4w000002O2GAAA0,0011U00000ri4O3QAI,Only been using XYZ for a short period of time.
a2p4w000002O2fZAAS,0011U00000rjuWhQAI,Convenient
a2p4w000002O2LtAAK,0011U00000rj0cOQAQ,"The staff is very nice, knowledgeable, and does everything in their power to address your medical needs."

a2p4w000002O1ihAAC,0014w000031g0RLAAY,It's hard to invest in a company when you don't know how long your corp will contract with them.
a2p4w000002O3DMAA0,0014w00002pQKkfAAG,Dr. Cramer is amazing
a2p3g000000oRaIAAU,0011U00000rk6EtQAI,The Dr really spends a great amount of time understanding the issue. I feel like I have the full attention of the Dr.
a2p3g000000oRh9AAE,0011U00000riF0bQAE,Extremely nice nurses and doctors. They take their time with you and genuinely care.
a2p1U000000RozyQAC,0011U00000riv23QAA,Free for Bemis. I like the Doctor
a2p1U000000Rq5HQAS,0011U00000rjSbbQAE,"Great service, great communication and awesome staff"
a2p1U000000RsYuQAK,0011U00000rj3wxQAA,There is hardly a wait to see the doctor
a2p1U000000RpzVQAS,0011U00000rjr5VQAQ,The doctor diagnosed me with the flu when I told him it was a sinus infection so after the appointment I went to my primary doctor and she prescribed me with antibotics. The doctor was not willing to listen to me as a patient!
a2p1U000000RtRXQA0,0011U00000rjEbSQAU,"I do not feel my needs are always addressed.  In most cases the doctor will send you away to take something over the counter or you're told to """"wait it out"""".  This is a waste of a $40 copyament.  If a patient feels ill enough they feel the need to seek treatment they are not paying to be told to suck it up.  Because of this I only request an appointment when I feel I can no longer manage my symptoms effectively on my own."
a2p1U000000RoATQA0,0011U00000rjOwjQAE,No wait.  Spacious and clean.  Friendly receptionist.  Dr. Funches is very nice.
a2p1U000000RokqQAC,0011U00000rjwb1QAA,"It's covered by the State, so if they are with the State as well I would definitely recommend it. Convenient, weren't many people when I went, etc."
a2p4w000002O3fVAAS,0011U00000rjw79QAA,PA Gavin is very attentive and truly cares about his patients.
a2p1U000000RswYQAS,0011U00000ritREQAY,"Convenience, reasonable cost, friendly people, on-site pharmacy, etc."
a2p1U000000l8CdQAI,0011U00000rjmq9QAA,The Medical Staff is very informative and professional.
a2p1U000000RpRXQA0,0011U00000rifWZQAY,I was thrilled I was able to get a same day appointment
a2p3g000000oeUbAAI,0011U00000rjfJVQAY,"As a supplemental medical care provider, XYZ offers convenience and individual attention. For screenings, vaccinations, sickness visits, it is much easier to get in than other medical practices in my experience."
a2p1U000000RpFCQA0,0011U00000ribPaQAI,Mccay is personable and is a good dr
a2p1U000000Rp3vQAC,0011U00000rjYzEQAU,"I think Dr. Martin was great, We had a very bad experience with Dr. Watts about 2 weeks ago. She ended up costing me thousands of dollars. I almost changed back to the other insurance, but decided to give Dr. Martin a chance and I felt good about this visit. He took time to listen to me."

a2p1U000000RsrVQAS,0011U00000ridTAQAY,Dr Everett and her assistant Maggie were very courteous and made me feel comfortable. It was my first visit and we got to know each other a little bit and start out with a basic health plan.
a2p1U000000Rox0QAC,0011U00000rijuzQAA,Easy to get an appointment in a timely manner.
a2p1U000000RszVQAS,0011U00000sgzHJQAY,Pretty good for primary care
a2p1U000000RowEQAS,0011U00000riHHaQAM,The Doctor provided excellent care. Like that it is part of my insurance plan.

a2p1U000000RouPQAS,0011U00000riMCSQA2,I arrived 20 min early before my apt there was no one in the office . I waited til about 3 after and saw the staff was back . Would of liked to of known no one was going to be there when I arrived
a2p1U000000RoEkQAK,0011U00000rk1orQAA,I can always get a same-day appointment and Dr. Everett is thorough in her examination and treatment options. She is willing to listen to my needs regarding treatment options.
a2p1U000000RpgEQAS,0011U00000riew2QAA,Quick appointment availability and the amount of time the doctor spent with me.
a2p3g000000KzLWAA0,0011U000011EjroQAC,Seen quick
a2p1U000000RpCnQAK,0011U00000rio6aQAA,"Dr. Fairbanks was a good doctor. There wasn't a long wait time. The experience was relatively pleasant, for a doctor's visit."
a2p4w000002O4OLAA0,0011U000011EqcjQAC,"I was very pleased with Dr. Mehrtens, however, accessing the app, trying to schedule an appointment and connect via video were unsuccessful. Jara was also very helpful getting me an appointment and connecting with Dr. Mehrtens."
a2p1U000000RsYtQAK,0011U00000rhqYPQAY,"I think this is good for quick simple check, if u not know what is going on better check with formal doctor."
a2p3g000000KzGlAAK,0013g000003or5wAAA,I would like a choice of different primary providers at my location.
a2p1U000000Rp8sQAC,0011U00000rjeIHQAY,Missed diagnosis.
a2p1U000000RsXjQAK,0011U00000riK5fQAE,I have been happy with the service I have received.  I find the staff professional.  The convenience of having them close by is what I like/appreciate the most.
a2p1U000000RoUcQAK,0011U00000rikoLQAQ,The was very attentive and asked a lot of questions
a2p1U000000RsifQAC,0011U00000rjXzYQAU,Ease of appointments and it covers most everything.
a2p4w000002O4NDAA0,0014w000031g0nyAAA,"The provider I saw yesterday was much better than others I’ve seen since the clinic switched to XYZ. First few visits were less than pleasant, but it seems to be improving now."
a2p1U000000RpUXQA0,0011U00000rj8ziQAA,dr malfese  has gone out of his way to help treat my condition. I didn't get that care from my primary care dr
a2p4w000002O3K8AAK,0014w000031g1cZAAQ,Same day appointment fast and  doctor was very thorough
a2p1U000000RqJzQAK,0011U00000rjmqBQAQ,"It's nice because there is no cost. However, I did not feel that the physical was very thorough. The doctor did ask about medical history, family history, etc but then he spent a lot of time just talking about stress and genetically modified foods. Would have been nice if he listened a bit more. The office also was short staffed. There were clearly people out or not scheduled and the staff were trying their best to get everything done. It made me feel a bit flustered too."
a2p1U000000RpUYQA0,0011U00000rj4fsQAA,"Local, friendly, professional"
a2p1U000000RpbHQAS,0011U00000ri0vvQAA,Do like that they don't have a lot of openings

a2p1U000000RpqGQAS,0011U00000riQ34QAE,Because You can get in quickly
a2p3g000000oeUlAAI,0011U000019xyecQAA,The office is weird and dirty and there is a poop emoji when you check in
a2p1U000000RpOYQA0,0011U00000rjCJnQAM,"Appointments are easy to make, sometimes even the same day."
a2p1U000000RpeNQAS,0011U00000riIhQQAU,"Friendly, timely, authentic."
a2p1U000000RpQ0QAK,0011U00000ri49RQAQ,Able to get an appt. quickly.   Doctor is easily accessible.   Friendly office staff.
a2p1U000000Rur7QAC,0011U00000sgxbcQAA,I am neutral at this point. Visit was pretty uneventful.
a2p1U000000Rva7QAC,0011U00000rj3PVQAY,It's only for Bemis workers and family members only so how can I recommend it to anyone else who doesn't work for Bemis
a2p1U000000RoQIQA0,0011U00000riocSQAQ,I felt with 1st visit the physician took time to know me.
a2p1U000000RsUQQA0,0011U00000riYwVQAU,Staff was aware of their job and everything was completed in a timely manner.
a2p1U000000RqCXQA0,0011U00000riIncQAE,not treated like a number
a2p3g000000oeU2AAI,0011U00001BfUApQAN,"The office and exam room looked old and run down and not very sanitary.  I have been 5'9"""" for the last 45 years and now I was told that I was 5""""7.5"""".  I came home and has my family measure me and I was 5'9"""".  The measuring stick on the wall in the exam room was totally crooked.  How can that be accurate?"
a2p1U000000RoInQAK,0011U00000sgxpUQAQ,"Good 1 on 1 service, and very friendly."
a2p1U000000Rq9vQAC,0011U00000rjkbLQAQ,"It seems harder to get spots same day so I'm stuck with a $100 bill for minute clinic.  I'm never told what the diagnosis is, just told what's being prescribed. I have had the acne issues for over 3 months now and just described more meds and told to go to a chiropractor when I am already being adjusted by my PT.  If our dr is not in we have to choose other options as the other refered my child to the ent to be scoped, I went for a 2nd opinion at the asthma dr and all that was needed was a steroid and it cleared her right up. The 1st time we saw the female there she was to suprised about another patient to focus on my child."
a2p1U000000RtM0QAK,0011U00000rjqf8QAA,dependable
a2p1U000000RsUhQAK,0011U00000rjYVNQA2,Friends do not work with the town
a2p1U000000RsXkQAK,0011U00000rjOY4QAM,"The hours and locations are not convenient, and the doctor does more chastising than listening to the patient before he offers his medical assessment. Then he chastised me for not seeing me in about 6 months, but its documented that it had only been 2 months. Also, before it had been unsuccessful for them to draw blood, but my last visit they were successful."
a2p1U000000RoBWQA0,0011U00000riPVhQAM,good service  sincere feeling
a2p1U000000RpzAQAS,0011U00000ripDKQAY,IT IS EXTREMELY CONVENIENT.  HOWEVER MANY OF MY FRIENDS ALREADY HAVE FAMILY PHYSICIANS THEY VISIT.
a2p4w000002NyEoAAK,0014w00002pPaR0AAK,"I have heard horror story after horror story since XYZ took over our employee clinic, but in all honesty between a visit I took my daughter to and an appointment I had to get the shingles vaccine, everyone was very polite, friendly, professional and any minor inconveniences (usually computer related) were not a big deal."
a2p3g000000KyoAAAS,0011U00000rj314QAA,I'll only recommend Scott Davidson
a2p1U000000RpqNQAS,0011U00000ri5L8QAI,I have only had ONE appointment as of now.

a2p4w000002O257AAC,0011U00000rifbFQAQ,Dr. Kelly O'Malia is a great doctor. I'm very satisfied with her.
a2p4w000002O35SAAS,0011U00000rjeaqQAA,Because my experience was good.
a2p3g000000KypfAAC,0011U00000ri6ABQAY,They seem like they care about the patient.
a2p1U000000RqSGQA0,0011U00000rk90bQAA,I think it is good for a family physician
a2p4w000002O4WoAAK,0011U00000rj9ILQAY,Because of the dr and her assistant are just wonderful
a2p4w000002O3BQAA0,0014w000031qBcqAAE,"People are friendly,not just a job to them!"
a2p1U000000Rp3kQAC,0011U00000rjac4QAA,"Great,friendly, knowledgeable Doctors."
a2p4w000002O2MhAAK,0011U00000rjr2pQAA,"Impresive professional works with staffs.  But, I'm unlikely visit to Drs' personally in general."
a2p4w000002Nzl0AAC,0011U00000riSKjQAM,Not my primary doctor.  You send appointment reminders and give the wrong address for the appointment.
a2p1U000000Rp1mQAC,0011U00000rjX8oQAE,The high levels of patient care
a2p3g000000KzoRAAS,0013g000002vQqxAAE,Even though I didn't have a physical and just did a phone visit I was very impressed with my doctor.  He listened to everything I had to say and was very compassionate!  I was very nervous about the phone call but he put me at easy .
a2p1U000000Rq6rQAC,0011U00000ri84eQAA,"Cheap, easy to get appt"
a2p4w000002O3LVAA0,0013g000006tfruAAA,like the dr's truth about what is wrong but offered no pain meds
a2p4w000002O2olAAC,0011U00000riRB1QAM,Dr.Sammon is a great partner in my quest for personal health…he listens and approaches health holistically…he is open minded and reliable.
a2p1U000000RpwVQAS,0011U00000rjMBLQA2,Only had 1 visit .. havent seen anything there to recommend.. no late hours or saturdays..
a2p1U000000RpUeQAK,0011U00000riq8nQAA,"I like how my doctor spent time discussing my health and preventative procedures that I did not know about. The clinic is located inside a Humana building so I don't think I can recommend to my friends and family who do not work at Humana and therefore, have no access to the building"
a2p1U000000RozXQAS,0011U00000riKbRQAU,The Puyallup office was great. The interaction and the Doctor was very understanding and detailed. I didn't feel rush as I use to over at the XYZ office in Federal Way.
a2p1U000000RpcAQAS,0011U00000rjdQaQAI,"While I'm at work at the office, it's extremely convenient, and you can't beat the cost!"
a2p1U000000RtRMQA0,0011U00000rjy2UQAQ,Depends on type of care they are looking for.
a2p1U000000RpFlQAK,0011U00000rirBxQAI,They're always friendly and quick to respond to our needs
a2p1U000000Rss8QAC,0011U00000rjkbPQAQ,I like Claudette and the staff there.
a2p1U000000Rp4bQAC,0011U00000rifEPQAY,The convenience of the location and availability of the doctors
a2p3g000000KzM2AAK,0011U00000rhrvCQAQ,It's a good deal that provides basic medical care for a low price.
a2p1U000000Ro7GQAS,0011U00000rhxguQAA,Professional staff. Friendly and helpful. Provide excellent medical care.
a2p1U000000RurdQAC,0011U00000ri8kNQAQ,"If there were someone new to Metalcraft and they asked for my opinion, I would tell them I like my XYZ Dr. very much."
a2p1U000000RowwQAC,0011U00000riWdaQAE,Staff and office were friendly yet professional. Time with not rushed.  Inquiry into issues were complete and if lead to another issue it too was covered.
a2p1U000000RplFQAS,0011U00000riPXtQAM,"I like the convenience of location, but the walk-in ability has been greatly reduced lately so that is the only reason the score isn't higher."
a2p3g000000KzKyAAK,0011U00000rigVcQAI,based on need and experience
a2p1U000000Rur6QAC,0011U00000rk0F6QAI,"Easy access,friendly staff"
a2p1U000000Rsk3QAC,0011U00000rk38kQAA,I don't know anyone that is a state of Colorado employee.  Otherwise it would be a 10.
a2p1U000000Rv7tQAC,0011U00000rj0MrQAI,Handy and my records are in one place
a2p1U000000Rp8GQAS,0011U00000riEKyQAM,My 1st visit was just a go see if this choice would work for me.   Found the Doctor to not to seem to be aware of what I was there for.  I found the doctor to be aggressive didn't listen to me and dismissive toward what I was saying.  Just visit it was like we were both on two different planes. I didn't feel comfortable I felt overwhelm actually with all the questions of past tests and passed this and past that I was just wanting to see if this could be a doctor that could help me do better with my health
a2p1U000000RphhQAC,0011U00000ritCLQAY,"Need to have more braces in office, its a pain to have to wait to buy one when you are in between paydays."
a2p1U000000Rps4QAC,0011U00000rk9NhQAI,Small clinic that is never busy with excellent patient care.
a2p1U000000RvLbQAK,0011U00000riFW9QAM,Quick and can usually get me into the schedule within a day.
a2p1U000000l8BWQAY,0011U00000riXe1QAE,"I've only had one visit; therefore, it's too soon to make an assessment"
a2p3g000000KzD9AAK,0011U00000rjuWtQAI,"While the convenience is great, two problems linger: 1) Dr. Malfese referred me to a urologist who then said I needed to see a nephrologist but still charged me for a specialist visit. 2) The general billing confusion with United Healthcare makes it difficult to know what I've actually paid and what actually to and to whom."
a2p1U000000RsW8QAK,0011U00000riggoQAA,"I love Dr. Haly and have the upmost confidence in her care, however the front office staff/assistant are unorganized and I did not feel confident in the ability for care and security."
a2p1U000000Rp4vQAC,0011U00000rinNPQAY,Love how personable staff are and they can always get me an appointment the same day.
a2p1U000000RtEVQA0,0011U00000riNI3QAM,The doctor was more worried about my past history than treating my chief complaint. I had a cold and needed meds to help clear me up. Almost like he wanted to see what my last doctor did to treat me than making his own decision.
a2p1U000000Rp7mQAC,0011U00000ri1nsQAA,Dr Cook seems concerned of my condition and qualified in how to treat it. Dr Lee is not available enough.
a2p1U000000RoaLQAS,0011U00000rjLDeQAM,I feel that I was not heard with my health concerns and just pushed off with a cough suppressant and inhaler (to which I did  not want/ need) while being told that I had a sinus infection. I feel that if I would have been treated for a sinus infection in the first place that I would have gotten better and all other symptoms would have subsided.
a2p1U000000RviGQAS,0011U00000rjDP3QAM,Very detailed check up. They take their time.
a2p1U000000RsYBQA0,0011U00000riHptQAE,They were kind and the appointments did not take up much time.
a2p1U000000RplDQAS,0011U00000rjdx5QAA,I never received a call on lab results as I was told I would
a2p1U000000RoWuQAK,0011U00000rjgXQQAY,No particular reason.  I just like the Direct Primary Care aspect.
a2p1U000000Rq1CQAS,0011U00000ri3vUQAQ,"I really like the high availability of the doctors, but the doctors often aren't as knowledgeable as I'd like. I shouldn't know more about most infections than my doctor."
a2p1U000000RoZzQAK,0011U00000rj7AkQAI,liked the one on one with the Doctor and you feel like they real are concerned about your well being
a2p1U000000RoXmQAK,0011U00000rjcbYQAQ,Told the doctor that my right side really hurt and I had been throwing up all day. Doctor said it would go away on its own - did not examine me at all. I ended up going to the ER where I was told I needed emergency surgery to have my gallbladder removed.
a2p1U000000Ro5zQAC,0011U00000rj27dQAA,"After I was brought into the patient room, I had to wait an additional 30 minutes to be seen due to their overbooking.  Also, I've left multiple messages about inquiring about my prescription and lab work but have not gotten a timely response."
a2p1U000000Rt8zQAC,0011U00000rjhepQAA,Sometimes I don't feel like the patient is being heard. Sometimes I feel like it is about the bottom line for the company and not about the care of the patient.
a2p1U000000RvCoQAK,0011U00000rk378QAA,Dr. was not happy that I haven't made XYZ my primary care.
a2p4w000002O4Y1AAK,0011U00000ri9tvQAA,Call backs are hard to come by
a2p4w000002O3dFAAS,0013g00000CxSlPAAV,The Dr’s attention and the feeling that he acknowledged all my issues
a2p1U000000RshvQAC,0011U00000rhyU6QAI,Friendly people.  Accommodated last minute.  Not the usual hour plus wait at other doctor's offices.
a2p1U000000RqWZQA0,0011U00000ri2beQAA,"On my last visit, I found it a bit frustrating that after checking in with the Receptionist, I sat in the waiting room for 25 minutes listening to everyone chit chat in the next room before being told I just needed to leave my form with them and they'd take care of it."
a2p1U000000Rt7cQAC,0011U00000rk2UXQAY,I'm still getting to know it...
a2p1U000000RsVDQA0,0011U00000rj9BRQAY,great experience.
a2p4w000002O4BqAAK,0011U00000rj1n7QAA,"Convenient appointments, friendly staff"
a2p1U000000RtFYQA0,0011U00000rj4fvQAA,Cheap easy and convient
a2p1U000000RoZLQA0,0011U00000rkD1hQAE,Personal care and not a rushed run-through.
a2p3g000000KzFoAAK,0011U00000rjsnJQAQ,It's good but there is always room for improvement.
a2p1U000000Ro4PQAS,0011U00000rjj4JQAQ,"Not everyone signs up for the insurance that covers XYZ, and my friends aren't members."
a2p1U000000Rq5xQAC,0011U00000rjiFHQAY,"Kind staff, convenient location, quick service"
a2p1U000000l8CuQAI,0011U00000ritnSQAQ,for me it is convenient and get just as good of service as an outside physician
a2p1U000000RpTCQA0,0011U00000rjMVKQA2,Easy to get an appointment. I like Dr. Song-Nichols. I get test results fast.
a2p1U000000l8FHQAY,0011U00000ri9KBQAY,"Friendly, caring, efficient"
a2p1U000000RoskQAC,0011U00000riNAFQA2,"The idea is a good one - convenience, everything in one place, etc. But recent turnover with physicians has added some hiccups. Seems overwhelming for one doctor to take on ALL of the patients by themselves and mistakes/rushing is bound to happen."
a2p1U000000Rpx3QAC,0011U00000rjXRwQAM,I don't think that colleagues have much of a choice but to go to XYZ.  If we don't we have to pay the high deductible at our prior PCP.
a2p1U000000Rq3zQAC,0011U00000riIUZQA2,"It was convenient, and quickly."
a2p1U000000l8CgQAI,0011U00000rin5JQAQ,The doctor there was very rude. I came there having chest pains and he was more concerned with seeing when I was going to leave my current physician. He also was speaking to me as if my doctor was doing something illegal as far as my meds. Several times he asked me what meds I was on. The nurse had already filled in all that information instead of looking at my chart. Not once did he check my vitals or anything to see if I was ok and I left that office in tears. I felt like I was a kid being scolded for having a previous doctor that has had my back for over 5 years. Nothing about that visit made me want to come back or even fell better after having pains in my chest and being stressed from work.
a2p1U000000RpQDQA0,0011U00000riFWVQA2,"Because Dr. Snyder is leaving. If she was staying, i would, and have, referred people to join XYZ and Dr. Snyder's office. Now that she's leaving, we'll have to see."
a2p3g000000KzFXAA0,0011U00001Amx9cQAB,"knowledgeable friendly staff apon entering, same day appt. Doctor explained a lot, took her time."
a2p1U000000RqI6QAK,0011U00000riTIYQA2,You have to be with a company that works with your company
a2p3g000000KzLfAAK,0013g000003rTQqAAM,Doctor did not perform any examination for the issue I came in for.
a2p1U000000RolTQAS,0011U00000riHYmQAM,"The office staff was friendly, the care team was not rushed and I felt listened to, and the facility was nice."
a2p3g000000KysHAAS,0011U00000rjKUbQAM,because. good care and trust Dr.
a2p1U000000RtMQQA0,0011U00000ricIZQAY,Friendly staff. Very available to patients.
a2p1U000000RocIQAS,0011U00000rjKUbQAM,don't give advice
a2p1U000000RqV4QAK,0011U00000rjOmTQAU,"The service and flexibility in scheduling is excellent. On my recent appt. I went in because of a problem with pressure in my ear. The Doc thought it was allergies, though I've never had allergies before and prescribed Sudafed PE and a nasal rinse. It has been about 2 weeks and no change in my condition."
a2p1U000000RpljQAC,0011U00000rijKUQAY,"great service, easy access, no wait time"
a2p4w000002Js9VAAS,0013g000007Za6XAAS,"Practitioners and staff are wonderful but the company's priorities seem backwards.  Branding seems to come second to providing services and the tech issues are persistent and resolution seems stalled.  I feel bad for the  wonderful practitioners who have to work with the tech. Staff and practitioners are AWESOME, except for the tech they have available to them that fails. How can a doctor see their patient when suddenly their chart isn't available to them or the video doesn't work?  I also don't understand why company business meetings are scheduled after patients appointments have already been made - I've had an appointment cancelled because management prioritized branding/marketing meetings/events.  Branding took precedent over patient care - disappointing to be canceled out of the blue for that reason. Suggest that appointments also be available after school hours at both locations for convenience - because of the 2 different locations and limited work schedules of the practitioners, appointments aren't easy to get. Great practitioners and good model otherwise. It's because of the practitioners that I like this company."
a2p3g000000qdsyAAA,0013g000003or5wAAA,Easy to contact provider
a2p4w000002K2YVAA0,0013g00000CgHnFAAV,"Friendly, informative, NP took time to listen."
a2p4w000001pnDJAAY,0013g00000KS9TuAAL,I don't have much to go on for a full reccomendation
a2p4w000002JvSuAAK,0011U0000125JT0QAM,Dr was very personable
a2p4w000001pxpmAAA,0013g00000CyYYFAA3,"Trailhead Clinics is amazing!  Dr. Boyer is wonderful.  Their service, attitude, knowledge, are all excellent."
a2p4w000002JuQsAAK,0011U00000rjvnnQAA,I like the idea of it but have been frustrated with the turn over of doctors
a2p3g000000qflLAAQ,0011U00000ri1Y2QAI,Like my doctor and the time he spends with me.
a2p3g000000qkp3AAA,0011U00000rixQMQAY,"Staff is great, response is quick, appointments are on time"
a2p3g000000qJuvAAE,0013g000006tegKAAQ,I really liked the doctor I saw during my recent visit on 2/2. The doctor I saw for my yearly check up was just okay. I also really appreciated how quickly XYZ was able to get me in. When I had Kaiser and had the original injury occur they couldn't get me in for three weeks despite being in a lot of pain. So getting in the same day was AMAZING!
a2p4w000001psSxAAI,0011U00000ri0i9QAA,"Not busy, very friendly staff."
a2p4w000002KHfbAAG,0013g000006tie0AAA,The environment is warm and pleasant. The doctor thoughtfulness and explanation of your medical condition is comforting. Everyone seems to care about your health and well-being.
a2p4w000001prU4AAI,0011U00000rk3VpQAI,The appointment was easy and on time
a2p3g000000qfsvAAA,0011U00000riyXJQAY,"I used to think this service was super convenient, but after my provider left, I felt like there were fewer choices for providers than I was happy with. Also with the shift in my work to working from home, the locations are not as convenient. Or if there is a convenient location, there is only one provider. Two years ago if you asked me about XYZ, I would say it was a great choice, but now, I think it's not that great."
a2p4w000002Jr9PAAS,0011U00000rjTDhQAM,Idk
a2p4w000002KAIBAA4,0011U00000ri5E4QAI,quick service
a2p4w000002K7rSAAS,0013g00000CwwVQAAZ,Service is good and waiting is not that long
a2p1U000000Rt9MQAS,0011U00000rjDskQAE,My visit was fast and was able to get my medication all at the same place. Customer service was great.
a2p3g000000KymTAAS,0011U00000ri7WMQAY,"Maybe it's because I previous had a Kaiser HMO, but the office felt very out-of-date, even using an under-the-tongue thermometer. The people were nice enough, but it didn't seem very professional or current. I'm not sure how to explain further."
a2p1U000000RqTOQA0,0011U00000rjinpQAA,Easy to get an appointment and Dr. was thorough.
a2p1U000000RqHaQAK,0011U00000rjW4jQAE,The manager and nursing staff are friendly people always willing to help and always demonstrate sincere concern for their patients. The new doctor is not as personable and does not seem to exhibit the same amount of care and concern for his patients.
a2p1U000000RodDQAS,0011U00000riAbNQAU,"I don't have enough information yet (haven't received test results or bills yet) to give it a full 10, but I was very pleased with the level of attention and time spent with the doctor."
a2p3g000000KzthAAC,0011U00000rhuKoQAI,I enjoy having a Dr that has time to talk to me and isn't just herding us through like cattle.
a2p1U000000RpttQAC,0011U00000rjLHEQA2,The cold I had evaluated turned much worse in the days after I was evaluated and no prescription was offered if symptoms worsened so I treated myself with over the counter medication and used my wife's prescription for antibiotic she was taking to manage my symptoms
a2p1U000000Rp8RQAS,0011U00000rjUPIQA2,The dr takes her time to really talk things through and takes the patients feelings about treatment into consideration
a2p1U000000RsyHQAS,0011U00000rjyWJQAY,"I like the idea of XYZ, but I was not impressed with our doctor. She gave several pieces of unsafe advice and was rather condescending."
a2p1U000000RoGyQAK,0011U00000riiodQAA,"Convince, flexibility and caring customer service"
a2p1U000000Rt5CQAS,0011U00000riqBJQAY,Initial appt was very thorough but the second seemed a little rushed
a2p1U000000RqHCQA0,0011U00000riqQyQAI,Doctor listened to patient history as well as described  what tests are needed.
a2p1U000000Rp9ZQAS,0011U00000rj0LMQAY,It's free to me.  I was paying $75 at another clinic for the same care.
a2p1U000000RoRpQAK,0011U00000rj0MwQAI,the doctors are usually on time and I'm not waiting 45 min in the room. appointments are fast but you are seen for everything
a2p1U000000RpwoQAC,0011U00000rhypSQAQ,I don't like my doctor :/ not very helpful
a2p1U000000RqfnQAC,0011U00000rjrb5QAA,The Dr's are very nice and caring.  They are willing to sit down with you and go over things without making you feeling rushed or like they don't want to help.
a2p1U000000RvHBQA0,0011U00000rk1ohQAA,The gynocologist left
a2p1U000000RtR8QAK,0011U00000riELbQAM,Easy to get in to see your doctor quickly.
a2p1U000000RtUUQA0,0011U00000riwv4QAA,Dr. was very pleasant and on time.
a2p1U000000RpP2QAK,0011U00000rjtwZQAQ,One doc is as good as another
a2p1U000000RqQpQAK,0011U00000rippNQAQ,very convenient
a2p3g000000KymVAAS,0011U00000rk83dQAA,Dr Morgan is the best there is. Always on top of things and very pro-active.  The staff is friendly and very professional.  And everyone is extremely caring and concerned.
a2p1U000000Rp7FQAS,0011U00000rjUikQAE,I would recommend to my fellow employees since XYZ is offered through my work.
a2p1U000000RoLnQAK,0011U00000rin53QAA,I was able to be seen on the day I called.  The medical team was friendly and professional.  I did not wait long.  Dr. Gray was knowledgable and caring/helpful.
a2p3g000000KyqQAAS,0011U00000rhzYUQAY,The provider (Stephen Wills) was excellent
a2p1U000000Rt2iQAC,0011U00000rjnAgQAI,I enyoued my visit
a2p1U000000RqHxQAK,0011U00000riUagQAE,I like being able to get in for an appt on short notice when I'm sick. I feel like the Dr's at XYZ really care about me as a person.
a2p1U000000RpoUQAS,0011U00000rjcpfQAA,Good doctor
a2p1U000000RpyJQAS,0011U00000riIhLQAU,"Easy to make appointments, I like my Dr."
a2p3g000000pX4AAAU,0011U00000riRLbQAM,staff is very nice.  Doctor seems empathetic and thorough.
a2p3g000000owKpAAI,0011U00001Bf8N5QAJ,Please tell us why
a2p3g000000owMMAAY,0011U00000rjNznQAE,i like being able to not have to weigh the need to see the doctor against the cost.
a2p3g000000pJqtAAE,0011U000019xyYlQAI,It was easy to get in and out quickly.
a2p3g000000pUDJAA2,0013g0000091uYzAAI,The provider I saw was amazing and gave me plenty of individualized time.
a2p3g000000pJmcAAE,0013g000002vORMAA2,"Had a few screw ups with my labs which was frustrating. Staff is really friendly, which I like."
a2p3g000000pP3xAAE,0013g000006tez2AAA,Ginni is a great NP
a2p3g000000pYpvAAE,0011U00000rk0ogQAA,They are very kind people in the office
a2p3g000000q98GAAQ,0011U00000rjw4UQAQ,"XYZ at the W. Market office has been great with Dr. Pfeiffer so far.  I was not as impressed with the White Pond office, which is why I did not rate this higher."
a2p3g000000pXxAAAU,0011U00000rj8ovQAA,Because lately all XYZ does is Only Phone or Video Appointments!!
a2p3g000000pmnFAAQ,0013g000009hMeCAAU,"Available appointment. 
Staff and doctor friendly"
a2p3g000000pSHiAAM,0011U000019xyZgQAI,It's convenient
a2p3g000000pbuKAAQ,0011U00000rjB7GQAU,Bad encounter with one of the doctors
a2p3g000000owKSAAY,0011U00000ri48rQAA,I like my doctor
a2p3g000000pXwCAAU,0011U00000riOCJQA2,My visitnwas
a2p3g000000ozGwAAI,0011U00000rinw1QAA,Good location- accessible to state offices. Easy to book an appointment. No long wait times to get in to see the doctor.
a2p3g000000psXIAAY,0011U00000rhyVYQAY,It is a great service and has no associated co-pays involved since the company pays monthly fees and the people are great.
a2p3g000000pW81AAE,0011U00000rhuarQAA,Staff was very friendly and efficient
a2p3g000000pPI9AAM,0011U000019xyXHQAY,"I was hit in the head two with the height measurement tool, and it took a lot of rooting around in my veins to get blood."
a2p3g000000oRgkAAE,0011U00000rjeVkQAI,Great service and environment
a2p1U000000Ro9zQAC,0011U00000rk0zqQAA,Great service and staff did an excellent job of making me feel comfortable.
a2p3g000000KzqsAAC,0011U00000rjDCxQAM,Lots of locations and good care.
a2p1U000000RqMNQA0,0011U00000riVTkQAM,"it was convenient location, but it's the first time I've been able to get in to see someone.  Either closed for training, or nothing available when really sick"
a2p3g000000KynyAAC,0011U00000rkBTwQAM,I really like my doctor and the zero copays is amazing.
a2p1U000000Ro9eQAC,0011U00000rjGqAQAU,Why not. Too early to be satisfied/dissatisfied.
a2p1U000000RoCGQA0,0011U00000rhx0WQAQ,"Friendly staff, short wait time and the Doctor was very nice."
a2p3g000000LAanAAG,0011U00000rhx0WQAQ,Poor comminucation
a2p1U000000Ror0QAC,0011U00000rijKtQAI,"I use it because my employer pays the subscription fee. Otherwise, as a young healthy person, the subscription is not worth it for me. Better for people who visit the doctor more frequently."
a2p1U000000Rq2JQAS,0011U00000riornQAA,great customer service
a2p1U000000RqHLQA0,0011U00000rj4bUQAQ,responsive cost effective care
a2p1U000000RsweQAC,0011U00000ri93NQAQ,Advertise walk-ins but they only take you in by appointment. Not familiar with the new doctor. Not sure is she had my previous history from Dr. Noble. Didn't get prescribed the same medication as previously to treat therfore extending my illness.
a2p1U000000RvGHQA0,0011U00000rj06vQAA,NUMBER OF REASONS I FEEL THAT MY PRESCRIPTIONS DON'T GET FILLED ON TIME THROUGH MY INS DUE TO LACK OF RESPONSE FROM EITHER RECEPTIONIST OR DR. I ALSO IT IS VERY HARD TO GET A HOLD OF SOMEONE ON THE PHONE.
a2p1U000000RpTHQA0,0011U00000rjjz0QAA,It is close and convenient.
a2p1U000000RoHeQAK,0011U00000rjC3DQAU,I don't recommend as city employees know all about the clinic.  In the last several months I am back and forth about service.  I will have an experience that irritates me and the next time could be just fine.
a2p3g000000oReKAAU,0011U00000rim8jQAA,"Convenient appointments, nice staff"
a2p1U000000Rp4BQAS,0011U00000rjC3DQAU,"I have lost some confidence with the XYZ process - no doctor replacement for Dr Hernandez, opening hours are later which makes me late for work, no blood draw without doc present which makes me late for work.  Just seemingly no organized flow.  Katie was gone for a while."
a2p1U000000RsfFQAS,0011U00000rjJHkQAM,Fast simple service
a2p1U000000Rq0PQAS,0011U00000rkCBWQA2,Excellent staff and doctor care.
a2p1U000000Rp1SQAS,0011U00000rjeK6QAI,Doc was very thorough and covered many topics concerning health issues in clear concise terms
a2p1U000000RsoOQAS,0011U00000sh1NIQAY,Customer service is pretty good. Not excellent but very close.
a2p1U000000Rt2dQAC,0011U00000rjsVBQAY,"Ease of use, good response time"
a2p1U000000RqQBQA0,0011U00000risWDQAY,easy and efficient
a2p1U000000RqEaQAK,0011U00000ri8ztQAA,It takes too long to get in
a2p1U000000RvbAQAS,0011U00000rivbNQAQ,"My Doc wants the best for me, she wants me off my med's as bad as I do! She does care about me"
a2p1U000000RoHrQAK,0011U00000ri9ztQAA,I thought the doctor was very unprofessional and seemed a bit scattered. I didn't really feel like she wanted to help me or get to the bottom of my issues.
a2p3g000000KyqaAAC,0011U00000zPYgEQAW,"I enjoyed the time taken by the staff to listen to me and provide me recommendations. I didn't feel rushed, which was a new feeling."
a2p1U000000RsugQAC,0011U00000ri1uBQAQ,Service was great and thorough.
a2p1U000000RpHjQAK,0011U00000rjbegQAA,The doctor and nurses were very kind and fast at there jobs
a2p1U000000RpXpQAK,0011U00000rj5AvQAI,Great for free!
a2p1U000000RoGoQAK,0011U00000rjb63QAA,"Only addressed one concern and not both I had scheduled appointment for and prescribed 2 forms of same med to 2 different pharmacies and I paid for both, having not paid attention to what the two meds were until I arrived home and opened them both."
a2p1U000000RqNIQA0,0011U00000rjUDwQAM,Timely quality service
a2p1U000000RqIZQA0,0011U00000riBZQQA2,"I had a sinus infection. I had symptoms for a few days indicating an infection. I was already on sinus/ allergy medicine and needed something more. I had to go to an Immediate Care center that weekend, because all the nurse practioner I saw would prescribe was more allergy medicine. A day after being on the anitibotic and steroide that the Immediate Care prescribed, I was feeling markedly better.  I had already been suffering for weeks and she made me suffer a couple more days without proper treatment.  We had a phone call set up for her to prescribe an antibiotic that following Monday, but I am glad I went and recieved proper treatment from a DR, not a nurse practicitioner. I frankly have no confidence in the physician staff. Earlier this month, my boss went, and I thought he just had a bad experience, but he had pneumonia and he ended up in the hospital because the physician he saw through the center also didn't prescribe an antibiotic.  Antibiotics are needed and the physician in your center are too hesitant to prescribe them.  I am in my 50's and have been through illnesses with three children. I think I have more practical medical experience than the nurse practitioner that I saw."
a2p1U000000Rq12QAC,0011U00000rj8p9QAA,"I was sent out of the office with strep, I was sick; needed antibiotics. I was shuffled away with some BS Flonase. (Which I tried to go to work the next morning thus exposing all my coworkers) I went to my bosses doctor the next morning because I knew my body was fighting an infection; within 30 mins of them swabbing my throat I had a positive test for strep!!!!"
a2p1U000000Rt1GQAS,0011U00000rjXz3QAE,"I like the location and the people there.  Sadly, there is no full-time doctor."
a2p1U000000RuuxQAC,0011U00000riqkvQAA,convienence and service of prof. staff
a2p1U000000RoQSQA0,0011U00000rjac4QAA,Good nice people
a2p1U000000Rt8ZQAS,0011U00000rhq1iQAA,"Easy, convenient.  Service was prompt and very competent."
a2p1U000000RoSrQAK,0011U00000riornQAA,"promp, friendly service.  convenience of having an office in the same building where I work."
a2p1U000000Ro6tQAC,0011U00000rjP3lQAE,"The nurse practitioner was wonderful, but the medical assistant was very pushy and turned me off a bit. The first time I called for an appointment, I was told it would be weeks and needed a 90 minute appointment to build a relationship with my doctor. I just needed seen for a cold. When the XYZ representative spoke at my school, he didn't let on that there would be anything like that. He spoke of same day visits and access. Then once XYZ called my wife a few weeks later, she explained it all, and they allowed me to come in for my cold on a one-time basis. As I pulled into the parking lot and checked my voice mail, I had several messages saying my appointment was canceled. That was a mistake luckily, and I was seen."
a2p1U000000Rt5vQAC,0011U00000riAkvQAE,Most of my co workers know the advantages of participating with XYZ
a2p1U000000RuxAQAS,0011U00000rj7yLQAQ,"I scheduled an appt because I was feeling horrible hoping to come in and get some relief so I could get back to work, but instead was sent home with nothing to help and w a diagnosis that didn't feel like any of the symptoms I had. Told to simply continue to use over-the-counter medicines that were not helping me. I continued to feel poorly until just yesterday, which is another 5 days after my appt. Not satisfied at all. Will be looking for a different primary care asap."
a2p3g000000KzIDAA0,0011U00000rjB4nQAE,"Great doctors, good location, quick service if something comes up, ability to call after hours.  Quite a few tests are available at the location."
a2p1U000000RqYuQAK,0011U00000riCFcQAM,"I felt like some of the comments the Dr. made seemed unprofessional. My wife and I both had appointments at the same time for an annual physical. We both have extensive health needs and in the process of explaining them, there were some innacurate statements made about our conditions, which made it seem like the doctor was not sensitive to our matters. The doctor, in an effort to feel relaxed, used cussing and other unprofessional language. It's not something extremely bothersome but was definitely something I remembered and was caught off guard."
a2p3g000000L1PUAA0,0011U00000rjGXoQAM,Follow up with patience is horrible
a2p1U000000RpuqQAC,0011U00000riHCmQAM,Quick and thorough.
a2p1U000000RpX5QAK,0011U00000rj0dpQAA,The NP took time to listen and evaluate my problem.  She was very caring.  The clinic is also convenient.
a2p1U000000RqAkQAK,0011U00000rk4l9QAA,Nice that we don't have to pay for labs & office visits however I don't understand why we don't get our labs done every year? There's so much that can happen within 1 year.
a2p1U000000RsXeQAK,0011U00000riTDvQAM,I wouldn't normally go to a general doctor for a laceration requiring stitches.  I only went because I had to.
a2p4w000002O4OaAAK,0014w00002pQGUaAAO,Over a day for a return phone call after I left a message. Among other things lately….
a2p1U000000RoDKQA0,0011U00000rjgpfQAA,Liked Dr. Miller. Have heard from many people it is nearly impossible to see a doctor when you need them that day. It seems as though XYZ has a VERY hard time keeping their talent.
a2p1U000000RqJ2QAK,0011U00000rk7b0QAA,Very friendly staff
a2p1U000000RqYzQAK,0011U00000riFWPQA2,"Able to get appointment quickly.  Pretty much satisfied with care . . . slightly out of my comfort zone with much discussion about """"supplements""""."
a2p1U000000RpXrQAK,0011U00000rjz6QQAQ,There wasn't much testing going on. I went to another dr and found out I had strep throat. No one even checked for that here.
a2p1U000000RuqQQAS,0011U00000rjgpxQAA,"I think it works for some people, but others with alit if health issues may need a clinic with more options right at XYZ such as x rays. We were also promised 50 generic drugs on hand and it's been up and running over a year and still haven't come through with them."
a2p1U000000Rp0UQAS,0011U00000sgxUEQAY,Consciousness staff/ Dr.
a2p1U000000RtKTQA0,0011U00000riD57QAE,"Convenient location, friendly staff, thorough questions from doctor about my health, blood lab on site (so you don't have to go somewhere else to get blood work done), and nice facility."
a2p1U000000RqLdQAK,0011U00000rk7pqQAA,"I think it's good for an urgent sickness, but routine, ongoing care is not a fit for me."
a2p1U000000l8GUQAY,0011U00000rihbDQAQ,I am too new and it's hard to tell after just one visit.
a2p3g000000oRmdAAE,0011U00000rjdx0QAA,The only thing they cared about was covid.  Didnt believe I had a fever .. said my thermometer was bad.
a2p1U000000RsWpQAK,0011U00000rjZgAQAU,The doctor did not know the answer to some of my medical questions about pregnancy and lipator.  When I said it was unsafe during pregnancy he said that's not true and then googled it.  He then replied he was wrong and it is unsafe to take if I become pregnant.  He could not tell me how soon I need to stop taking the medication.
a2p1U000000RpXoQAK,0011U00000rhuIyQAI,good customer/patient care
a2p1U000000RqWfQAK,0011U00000rj6rFQAQ,I've had some difficulty making timely appointments. The physician choices are questionable. The providers have very little knowledge of additional local providers to refer to (specialists).
a2p1U000000RsULQA0,0011U00000riBtnQAE,"I went only as part of my insurance coverage, but had a great experience."
a2p4w000002O3YAAA0,0011U00000rjaYbQAI,"Although somewhat satisfied, the last few times of contacting two different offices the response has been days and some with no response. I personally sit on the Health Benefits committee and this is not what was agreed or offered to APS. If I send an detailed email and am asked to call and make an appointment, the time it takes to do that and give detailed info and back and forth verbally with assistant instead of taking care of at point of contact is worthless to me."
a2p3g000000pg1KAAQ,0011U00000rjaNWQAY,"Good doctor, quick appointments, and convenient location for me."
a2p3g000000pv8VAAQ,0013g000009hIxrAAE,Brand new to XYZ still.
a2p1U000000RpcdQAC,0011U00000rj2hqQAA,I like the convience
a2p3g000000pnmNAAQ,0011U00000ri2ikQAA,"Low cost, on-time appts"
a2p1U000000RprGQAS,0011U00000rikFsQAI,Doctor turn over. The new doctor did not take anytime to get to know me or did not seem to care.
a2p1U000000RpCyQAK,0011U00000ri4X9QAI,Easy to access

a2p1U000000RofAQAS,0011U00000rjJyiQAE,I liked the intimacy and attention the physician allowed me.
a2p3g000000q6S8AAI,0013g000007P2QeAAK,Great service. Was in & out in a timely manner. Communication with DR. and staff was great.
a2p3g000000q4dnAAA,0011U00000rjQbKQAU,Physician used to be very responsive and provide personal service. I feel like service levels have deteriorated significantly in the last year.
a2p3g000000q5WYAAY,0013g000006tglRAAQ,The nurse didn't seem very friendly and she didn't wear gloves when taking my blood which I thought was strange. The exam room also felt small and I just didn't feel comfortable/at ease there.
a2p1U000000Ro5dQAC,0011U00000rjNX1QAM,"Doctor is very cold. Her work history with low income drug addicts has made her look at people (of color) on a negative light. As I'm trying to tell her the improvements I'm making, she kept saying things about her old patients and what they did."
a2p3g000000pg2mAAA,0011U00000ri7WKQAY,Very easy to use.
a2p3g000000pw16AAA,0011U00000riZYXQA2,"Response is great. Not a full 10 because if someone needed more specialist advise, a larger clinic might be better."
a2p1U000000Rp9QQAS,0011U00000rhwjfQAA,"Front desk was really helpful, I was running late and I went back into a room quickly. The doctor was willing to listen to me tell my long story (my reason for the visit) she gave me options(very informative) so I was pleased. At the end we did have a miscommunication about the medicine. I don't think I was explaining it correctly or either she was not listening. I was concerned about taking both of the medicine and I think she assume I knew her computer system(about Medicine)...It was no big deal but sometime we think customer know what we know and they don't because they don't do what we do daily. I have done the same thing so now I try to put myself in the customer's shoes and try not to make it too simple to insult them but fine that fine line of communication.. We all are different. Overall I like the doctor and the crew."
a2p1U000000RswWQAS,0011U00000rkCisQAE,The wait time was entirely too long.
a2p3g000000oRhnAAE,0011U00000rj90PQAQ,No copay. Excellent service. Ability to get all tests and exams in one place.
a2p1U000000RpudQAC,0011U00000rihYAQAY,Ease of appointment scheduling. Very friendly doctor who did a thorough examination. She called me back the next day with my blood results.

a2p1U000000RqDBQA0,0011U00000rjdu7QAA,Follow up could be better.
a2p3g000000LAfGAAW,0011U00000riK5fQAE,I feel I am able to get an appointment with my doctor sooner than I would at another practice.  I trust my doctor and have confidence in the diagnosis I receive.

a2p1U000000Rqb1QAC,0011U00000ripXHQAY,"Overall, I liked the experience, although it's really quiet.  I suggest music or a tv in the waiting room."
a2p1U000000Rp5UQAS,0011U00000rimPKQAY,Because it is convenient and the staff is friendly
a2p1U000000RoGVQA0,0011U00000rigVcQAI,"I WAS SATISFIED WITH THE LOCATION, DR+STAFF, THE PERSONAL ATTENTION,ATTITUDE AND CHEMISTRY WITH THE DR. + STAFF,TIME  IT TOOK  FOR APPT.FRIENDLINESS,AND HOW I WILL BENEFIT BY GOING TO THE SITE FOR MY MEDICAL NEEDS AND THE  STRATEGY OF PRE EMPTING  DISEASE  BY WELLNESS PRORGAMS!"

a2p1U000000Roi9QAC,0011U00000rjZKXQA2,Good visit with the doctor. Very informative and like that he spent time to get to know me and the issues.
a2p4w000002JsVHAA0,0011U00000rk3aHQAQ,"Called for an appointment, was advised that ""because of COVID precautions"" for my suspected ear infection I needed to do a telehealth visit.  First telehealth visit scheduled for next day, when appointment time arrived, received a phone call that went straight to voicemail.  Attempted to call office multiple (in excess of 4 times) with no answer.  Was finally able to schedule for the next day.  Physician Assistant was late by almost 10 minutes.  Was told that I would need to be seen.  The location closest to my home was not open/available so I was given the option to drive 45 minutes to another location, but multiple days later.  What is clear to me is that XYZ is taking advantage of the COVID situation  in offering less than promised staffing levels as evidenced by my North Canton location being understaffed for months.  My employer was led to believe that the services offered its' employees would be  close to their residences and not a significant inconvenience as I have experienced.  I am not pleased at all with XYZ."
a2p4w000001prz2AAA,0011U00000riv1PQAQ,Convient location

a2p4w000002K5EEAA0,0011U00000rjfnUQAQ,"I am not much on phone conversation, I like doing my business face to face with DR"
a2p4w000002KKkKAAW,0011U00000rjrezQAA,"Most of my friends, family live out of the coverage area for XYZ Health. I'd like to think my colleagues are more than capable of making their own healthcare decisions. I would offer my own opinion, but would not sway them one way or another."
a2p4w000002NysKAAS,0011U00000riKHLQA2,"I have enjoyed all visits until this one. I really liked Dr. Freeman, but the white pond office staff (the girl at the front desk)was not welcoming or even kind in an already stressful situation. I recommend the other locations wholeheartedly though."
a2p4w000002NzMjAAK,0011U00000rjlznQAA,I like the place and the dr but not the medical assistant
a2p4w000002Nz9fAAC,0014w00002pQINGAA4,I enjoy the service but the office isn't very efficient sometimes.

a2p4w000002O4bAAAS,0011U00000ri92gQAA,"I think it is a valuable service, however every time you get used to one provider they leave for other places and you have to start with someone new."

a2p3g000000qNrbAAE,0011U00000rjdSiQAI,Little to no waiting with scheduled appointments and time with dr

a2p1U000000RpzvQAC,0011U00000rjCJrQAM,"I like Dr. Bernardy, it's easy to make appointments, no wait time when arriving for my appointments and good follow up by the doctor."
a2p1U000000RpSAQA0,0011U00000rk90bQAA,It is not the same with my new health care provider. Pretty disappointed.
a2p1U000000RpTlQAK,0011U00000rkBYaQAM,XYZ is the city's health care provider.
a2p1U000000RoRaQAK,0011U00000riv20QAA,The Staff is wonderful. Doctor Song is very professional but still keeps mood light.

a2p1U000000RseIQAS,0011U00000rjWhpQAE,I feel that the Doctors have the time to listen to what I have to say and include me as part of the health team when it comes to my health.
a2p1U000000RpoPQAS,0011U00000riLV5QAM,Sometimes the location of the doctor is not convenient to where I am.

Additionally, my results were written down on a post-it note - who knows if they were transferred properly after I left."

a2p4w000002O1GYAA0,0011U000011hU2lQAE,"Well when I came.to see the nurse practitioner about a skin thing, I wanted to address the fact that I was putting on weight and never got to the other things that concerns me, because I have told him I just went back to work at APS and he says, oh, from sitting around. I don't ""sit around"" I have another job for his information. As a matter of fact, I'm really pissed off about it!"
a2p4w000002O0k8AAC,0011U00000rjz13QAA,It is fairly easy to get an appointment and I appreciate that they get you right back to see the doc.

a2p4w000002NynPAAS,0014w000031g27BAAQ,it toke 21/2 hours just to get my medicine refilled and they did not have all my medicine that i need
a2p4w000002O0L8AAK,0014w00002pQBo0AAG,"Spent too much time arguing with Dr. just out of med school over what specialest to see and perscriptions.  He has a bad attitude.  Said would give perscription be never did.  Been taking same perscrion for 12 years but told no.  Refered to specialest.  Specialest said why were you reffered to me if you have this problem, you're in the wrong place.  He will say ""i don't know how to treat this, except with this medicine"" or ""I never had much luck treating that"".

To make things worse he is the only Dr available out of 3 locations.  THe other Dr Kordic is not seeing new patients.
Need to change insurance plans at the end of the year to get new medical Drs.
Until then its a nurse or UMC Medical Care."

i had a friend call to go in but was told he could not since he wasn't a state employee"
a2p4w000002O0fDAAS,0011U00000riqkTQAQ,Seems efficient and easy to get an appointment within a day or so.
a2p4w000002O0yjAAC,0011U00000rjfJVQAY,"I like getting the full attention of the doc for a good amount of time. The services are somewhat limited compared to a normal GP, so that lowered the rating a bit."

a2p1U000000RpiPQAS,0011U00000rjxR7QAI,Dr. only prescribed meds to fix the symptoms and not figure out the root of the problem. Then was told to come back in a week.
a2p1U000000RupVQAS,0011U00000riFyWQAU,courteous and efficient staff
a2p1U000000RsWsQAK,0011U00000riUpIQAU,Some great things are offered but could stand room for improvement with privacy since we are most likely to know the other individuals waiting in the waiting room because they are co-workers. I also didnâ€™t get a great first impression from Dr. Glaser
a2p3g000000KzBLAA0,0011U00001Be6TaQAJ,Nice staff! Really nice office and everyone made it a good experience!
a2p1U000000RsqGQAS,0011U00000rj8TWQAY,Pretty good place. Love that you can call the doc and he gets on the phone. Haven't really had any serious issues so can't really know how well they do when things get serious/intense.
a2p1U000000RtA9QAK,0011U00000rjW9xQAE,Very good and caring doctors and nurses
a2p1U000000RsXdQAK,0011U00000ribAEQAY,I feel the program has been explained enough that people are able to make a decision based on what's best for them.  I have only used XYZ in a limited capacity thus far and don't offer much to change their current views.
a2p1U000000RsUTQA0,0011U00000riXz0QAE,I went in for a flu shot - wasn't an appointment w/ dr.
a2p1U000000RpfwQAC,0011U00000riLoxQAE,"I sat in the doctors office for 2 hours listening to him talk about himself, 5 minutes were actually spent on me"
a2p4w000002O4cDAAS,0011U00000riSEGQA2,I’m concerned that the name changed from XYZ health and there was no notification.
a2p4w000002O4OuAAK,0013g000007ZYRTAA4,"When we first came to altais, everyone was welcoming, patient, and extremely helpful. It was always really easy to get an appointment at a time convenient to us. We have since started to see people we connected with leave the clinic. Now the available providers are only there limited days/hours, making it difficult to see them at a time that works for us :(
The front desk/face of the clinic, Jessica, is short with us (as if we are bugging her), rushes us through, (she often seems more interested in talking/gossiping with and makes it seem she’s knowledgeable, when she really isn’t. We miss Esther and Jenny. We will miss Michelle and Sarah as we transition to other providers (who do not have the accessibility we’ve grown accustomed to)."
a2p4w000002O4TaAAK,0011U00000rigwaQAA,good service
a2p1U000000Rq0eQAC,0011U00000rjjPrQAI,I had an urgent issue that needed to be taken care of right away. I walked in without an appointment and while talking to the nurse the doctor overheard the problem I was having. She told the nurse to squeeze me in & she would see me in 20 minutes. I walked out of the clinic 30 minutes later with my prescription in hand. The following week the doctor called to see how I was doing. I was surprised that she took the time to call me.
a2p1U000000RswsQAC,0011U00000rj0xhQAA,Service was friendly and professional
a2p1U000000RsaQQAS,0011U00000rjx0IQAQ,Personal service.  The doctor took time to discuss my health as a whole.

a2p1U000000RoJ5QAK,0011U00000riEfaQAE,"well you use to be able to go right in , now sometimes you sit a long time before being brought back into a room. also when you call now no one answers you have to leave a message , thanksfully I can go on line and make an appointment except for my allergy shots which I still have to call several times to get an appointment for since I cant go on line for those."
a2p1U000000RtIhQAK,0011U00000rir0WQAQ,convenience and high availability
a2p1U000000RpMSQA0,0011U00000rjmXIQAY,"I only deal with XYZ at Lincoln electric and making a non sick ""same day"" appointment has a very long wait. Doctors constantly are leaving and being replaced, like a never ending cycle"
a2p1U000000RpXgQAK,0011U00000rj7n7QAA,I like the facilities.  I like the care.  I have an AWESOME doctor!
a2p3g000000L02rAAC,0011U00000ripG5QAI,"Dr. Heather Thomas spoke with me on the phone at 11:30 on May 26, 2020. After I told her my symptoms she said, ""You have COVID-19 and I have to report you to the Health Department."" I explained I have acute chronic sinusitis, but that didn't matter to her. I then called back and asked where I could take a test, since she didn't bother telling or asking me to get one done. I am very upset with the lack of sympathy shown and the automatic assumption of what I have."
a2p1U000000RskDQAS,0011U00000riRUHQA2,"I really like having Dr Cook as my DR but I was really disappointed that he will no longer be here at Federal Way and there was no advanced notice. Know if I want to see him I will have to take quite a bit of time out of my work day to travel down to Tacoma if I want to see him. This week we haven't had a Dr here for 3 days. It's hard for me when Dr's  and Asst's. are always rotating in and out of this office. It takes time to build a trusting relationship with a DR. and when you have Dr""""s rotating in and out there's a higher chance of mistakes or having to explain over and over to a new Dr what's going on with your health.  I'm not sure if I will stay with XYZ because I would like to have just 1 PCP otherwise I could just sign up for Group Health :-( or go to a Doc in a Box."
a2p1U000000RsSIQA0,0011U00000riYFtQAM,Very comfortable atmosphere.  I didn't feel like a number.
a2p1U000000l8FRQAY,0011U00000rjd6kQAA,"The rooms were not well insulated, so I could hear what was going on in other rooms.  The initial session was significantly less time than was scheduled, and they could not find part of the EKG to run a test on me."
a2p1U000000RosWQAS,0011U00000riXLVQA2,"I did not know there was a different doctor. I joined XYZ because I heard wonderful things about Dr. Thomas. When my appt. was confirmed, it did not have the name of the new Dr."
a2p1U000000RtJWQA0,0011U00000rjLoJQAU,You have a great staff
a2p1U000000RqaRQAS,0011U00000rjKTsQAM,Bad location
a2p1U000000RpqCQAS,0011U00000ri6QrQAI,difficult to contact Dr.
a2p1U000000RoM2QAK,0011U00000rj8zaQAA,Buena atencion
a2p1U000000RprKQAS,0011U00000rk683QAA,easy appointment
a2p1U000000RpgRQAS,0011U00000ri30OQAQ,I have congestion in my ear. I was prescribed ear drops. These drops were over $200.00. REALLY!!! That's just insane. They should know the cost of what they're prescribing. I have a high deductable healthcare plan with a deductable. I did not get this prescription filled because of the cost to me.
a2p1U000000RvSEQA0,0011U00000rjJ9eQAE,"Low cost, ease of service"
a2p3g000000KzD7AAK,0013g000003ohgiAAA,No Doctor available. Nurse Practitioner available did not seem very experienced or knowledgeable. Had heard of good experiences here but didn't have one during my appointment.
a2p1U000000Rq51QAC,0011U00000riXb7QAE,Convenient to my work location. I'm still confused about payments.
a2p1U000000RoaKQAS,0011U00000rjkhtQAA,I don't typically recommend doctors to people.
a2p1U000000RuvFQAS,0011U00000rjLm3QAE,"Friendly, thorough, don't rush you in and out, make sure any question you have are answered."
a2p3g000000L1OcAAK,0011U00000rjA1VQAU,"I feel that the care I receive from Dr. Bernardy is prompt, patient, thoughtful, and thorough."
a2p1U000000RobgQAC,0011U00000rjeI4QAI,Dr. Heather Thomas and her staff very professional and welcoming.
a2p1U000000RpjuQAC,0011U00000riLm1QAE,While convenient?  My health need was not resolved?
a2p1U000000Rp3UQAS,0011U00000ri6H1QAI,?
a2p1U000000RszKQAS,0011U00000rjCJGQA2,"I like the one-stop shop aspect of it. And the whole-body health perspective. However, it's extremely difficult to change doctors under it. A provider has opened just a block from my office since I signed up, and I went there once with a concern, but that doctor just indicated she'd tell the regular one what happened. Frustrating."
a2p1U000000Rp8mQAC,0011U00000rij9qQAA,"Friendly and helpful staff. Short wait times, and an overall enjoyable experience."
a2p1U000000RqR8QAK,0011U00000rk3S1QAI,every thing we well
a2p4w000002O0TqAAK,0011U00000riljhQAA,"XYZ is great, but CIGNA is a pain"
a2p4w000002O34UAAS,0014w000031qlzoAAA,"I do not get the care I ask for. 
Ex: I  specifically asked for a TB blood test, it was not done.
I asked that my blood pressure medicine be changed, Dr would not change it. 
It seems as though all of my care is more beneficial to the insurance company ."
a2p4w000002O0xWAAS,0014w00002pPl2rAAC,No copay and free medicine
a2p4w000002O2xJAAS,0011U00000riXmeQAE,"No copays, bloodwork done there."
a2p4w000002KIttAAG,0014w00002pPb08AAC,Good attention. Bilingual personal
a2p4w000002NyM4AAK,0011U00000riboQQAQ,they are very good. they take time to answer questions etc
a2p4w000002O1yGAAS,0014w00002pQGceAAG,"Friendly, interested personnel"
a2p4w000002KJXoAAO,0011U00000riZpNQAU,"Efficient, accessible, friendly."
a2p4w000002O1UuAAK,0011U00000rhrG2QAI,Its none of my business
a2p4w000002NyCEAA0,0014w00002pPauSAAS,It’s been a day and still waiting for the results
a2p4w000002O1RbAAK,0011U000019y5tFQAQ,Personalized care.
a2p4w000002KJYcAAO,0014w00002pPazSAAS,too soon to tell
a2p4w000002O2cfAAC,0014w00002pPasiAAC,Dr. Peterson was very friendly and personable.
a2p4w000002NyiyAAC,0011U00000rim8jQAA,Dr Watson is a good Dr and person. She really cares
a2p4w000002O236AAC,0014w000031g0cTAAQ,"Very unorganized!! The portal was not explained and when I contacted costumer service it took over 10 mins for them to tell me that I can not register myself, I have to register under my husband."
a2p4w000002O1lbAAC,0011U00000riwpjQAA,Very nice Doctor and Nurses
a2p4w000002O2egAAC,0011U00000rj3xxQAA,Quick scheduling and friendly staff
a2p4w000002KKptAAG,0014w00002pPasOAAS,very responsive to me.

a2p4w000002O20MAAS,0014w000031rTKPAA2,Not a fan of Doctors. Never will be.
a2p1U000000Rp33QAC,0011U00000rjvTDQAY,In the past I felt like my doctor and the staff were more in the know regarding my health concerns medications and overall health. Now it is not as personalized and the providers seem to be less engaged
a2p1U000000RtUaQAK,0011U00000rjbGwQAI,"PA's were nice and friendly, but doctor was too casual in his approach and it came off as somewhat unprofessional. I understand the way XYZ is trying to treat it's patients and build a more comfortable relationship between the doctor and patient, but the experience I had failed to do so."
a2p1U000000RssKQAS,0011U00000rhxGNQAY,It was nice
a2p1U000000Rof8QAC,0011U00000riVj7QAE,Efficient check-in process.  Professional environment.  Almost immediately taken after checking in versus waiting up to an hour to be seen like some visits at other places.
a2p1U000000Rp6OQAS,0011U00000rj03PQAQ,"Getting an appointment was really easy and it was convenient to work. However, the dr I met with didn't instill a lot of confidence."
a2p1U000000RqYqQAK,0011U00000ri1nnQAA,convenient
a2p1U000000RoE8QAK,0011U00000rimPuQAI,Doctor Glaser was very inviting and easy to talk to.
a2p3g000000oRhsAAE,0011U00000riFWeQAM,Great care that is easy to access.
a2p1U000000RpFzQAK,0011U00000ri9K4QAI,"Great service, good drs, convenient."

a2p3g000000oRZaAAM,0011U00000rjxieQAA,"I have always found the doctors and staff to be very professional, knowledgable and caring."
a2p1U000000RsXBQA0,0011U00000ritR7QAI,They are okay.
a2p1U000000RqJIQA0,0011U00000rjts0QAA,"Because, they said they would call a script in and they didn't waited all weekend."
a2p1U000000RvPxQAK,0011U00000riNWkQAM,The people/doctor are very pleasant and accommodating.
a2p1U000000RtMyQAK,0011U00000rjnbRQAQ,Friendly and fast service
a2p3g000000KzrTAAS,0011U00000rjwbCQAQ,Doc is understanding and helpful
a2p1U000000RtQdQAK,0011U00000rjb6ZQAQ,"The nurse practioner, doctors, and nurse are great but the office staff are not friendly and have lack of good customer service skills"
a2p1U000000Rsl6QAC,0011U00000riMCrQAM,"There was a re-scheduling fiasco that made the visit stressful, however Dr. Roberts is fantastic."
a2p1U000000Rt5jQAC,0011U00000rjsBNQAY,"I did not have a bad experience with the nurse myself, but I too am in HealthCare and know a little about behavioral interviewing and how the questions were posed to me I don't think are appropriate for a broad audience.  In talking to me she was saying...""you don't do drugs right..."" You don't smoke right"" -- I feel like for people who want or need to answer yes to those types of questions the way it was framed up makes that hard."
a2p1U000000RonkQAC,0011U00000riovVQAQ,"Fast, courteous service. People care about my health."
a2p1U000000RtDmQAK,0011U00000riTsAQAU,Friendly staff and physicians
a2p1U000000RpaFQAS,0011U00000ri1ZGQAY,Easy to make appointments and see a Dr.

a2p1U000000Rq6hQAC,0011U00000rhzRtQAI,Dr was very professional and thorough.
a2p4w000002O4CoAAK,0014w000031rRB4AAM,Not for Type 1 Diabetics
a2p1U000000RpdpQAC,0011U00000rjoKfQAI,"Dr. Roberts explains in detail what is going on and ask if you have questions, to make sure you understand what is going on."
a2p1U000000RtKeQAK,0011U00000rjFWoQAM,"My husband and I have had some issues with XYZ with customer service, overall experience, painful needle sticks and lack of follow up."
a2p1U000000RqXWQA0,0011U00000riS1TQAU,"Love the casual and attentive environment, love my doc!"
a2p1U000000RqXxQAK,0011U00000ri850QAA,"I like the convience, i am a little unhappy on the response time. It took me a while to have any results on getting my referral done and i had to ask mulitple times. Also leaving a message at the office the response time is 2-3 day later. i have never had a problem until lately."
a2p1U000000Rsg4QAC,0011U00000rjdevQAA,Staff is friendly and courteous and the physician is attentive and helpful.  XYZ is a relatively new service for my family so it is a little too early to tell whether services promised by the Town of Mt. Pleasant in regards to XYZ will pan out.
a2p4w000002O3nPAAS,0011U00000rjxieQAA,Knowledge of my conditions and professionalism
a2p1U000000RpYwQAK,0011U00000rjedAQAQ,I don't feel rushed. The doctor is taking the time to talk to me
a2p1U000000RpNkQAK,0011U00000rjNtEQAU,Actually spent more than 10 Minutes with the doctor!
a2p1U000000l8KDQAY,0011U00000rhtWVQAY,"Quick, efficiant  and   good   service."
a2p1U000000RoXjQAK,0011U00000rjmXkQAI,Ease of getting in and time spent with patient.
a2p1U000000RpPcQAK,0011U00000riPp9QAE,"Seemed like a """"low rent"""" unprofessional office."
a2p1U000000Ro80QAC,0011U00000rjpByQAI,They were pleasant and caring. Also quick.
a2p3g000000LAcVAAW,0011U00000riybOQAQ,Staffs are super friendly and detail. Dr is down to earth and good.
a2p1U000000RpXwQAK,0011U00000rhwjtQAA,Phone and text.  Being able to diagnose symptoms over the phone without a visit to the office
a2p1U000000RurKQAS,0011U00000ripXDQAY,More personal care. Not rushed through.
a2p1U000000Rp6WQAS,0011U00000rjxhDQAQ,"so far I have not been able to get my questions answered, maybe on the next visit I will start to get some answers"
a2p1U000000RpdZQAS,0011U00000ri0eLQAQ,"XYZ is concierge healthcare, and only available through certain employers who subscribe to this service.  A very high % of coworkers are already on XYZ, and I cannot recommend XYZ to people who can't get this service (family, friends, etc.).  This really isn't a good survey question."
a2p1U000000RqXVQA0,0011U00000riS1TQAU,"For me, location, ease of getting an immediate appointment, and the personalized care."
a2p1U000000RoyFQAS,0011U00000riepoQAA,nothing great; nothing wrong
a2p1U000000Rt3rQAC,0011U00000rjy2ZQAQ,Dr Song-Nichols is always attentive and innovative. Shavona is a sweet and capable. I always feel better after a visit
a2p1U000000RvUEQA0,0011U00000rijxYQAQ,I feel it's is difficult to get a appointment in a timely manner.
a2p1U000000RsYOQA0,0011U00000rjjxuQAA,Good service.
a2p1U000000RsUmQAK,0011U00000rihVvQAI,Ease of access and communication directly with the doctors
a2p1U000000RtIlQAK,0011U00000rhzPtQAI,"Office visit was Quick, No paperwork because I did everything at home on the website. There was no wasted time. Staff was kind and efficient with their time."
a2p1U000000RpezQAC,0011U00000rjjxRQAQ,They were very prompt and assisting in nature.
a2p1U000000RqALQA0,0011U00000rihVtQAI,my understanding is it is for employees only.  I do give positive feedback about utilizing a company doctor.
a2p1U000000RqIFQA0,0011U00000rj6rFQAQ,"Good access to care and physicians. They don't seem to be ingrained in the community and have knowledge about other providers and specialists for referrals. I have seen several of the XYZ docs and have not """"clicked"""" with any of them yet."
a2p1U000000RoZWQA0,0011U00000rjGCyQAM,I don't live here
a2p1U000000RoekQAC,0011U00000riyGJQAY,Is good and friendly environment
a2p1U000000RvQSQA0,0011U00000riMplQAE,Long wait time and Dr. was in her office the whole time I was waiting in the room. No one else was in the clinic. Finally got fed up after a hour and 20 minutes and walked out.
a2p4w000002O4INAA0,0011U00000rjaI4QAI,XYZ is fine.  I just have a really hard time seeing my own doctor.  She seems unavailable all the time.
a2p4w000002O2E4AAK,0014w000031qiUmAAI,"Convenient location.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff"
a2p4w000002KKXGAA4,0011U00000riy78QAA,My first experience with XYZ was positive.
a2p4w000002O34AAAS,0014w000031psDXAAY,Sore throat plugged ears. Didn’t even check all that was concerned was 2 Covid tests. No care for my symptoms. Was told to to keep taking NyQuil for symptoms that have been around for over 7 days.
a2p4w000002O31pAAC,0011U00000riSbIQAU,The doctors here do a great job and they are very nice.
a2p4w000002O35wAAC,0011U000011hqpTQAQ,It is easy to schedule appoints and speak with the doctor.
a2p4w000002O3CdAAK,0014w00002qmOQCAA2,I like the team aspect of it but only certain people can join XYZ. Their employer has to have it
a2p3g000000LAfQAAW,0011U00000sgzHCQAY,Good service
a2p1U000000RoeIQAS,0011U00000rjQKxQAM,"Great service, fast"
a2p4w000002O40OAAS,0014w00002pQGcmAAG,I expect the phone appt. would be longer.
a2p4w000002KKTEAA4,0013g0000091uYVAAY,Works for me. Very responsive. and i love Dr. Black.
a2p4w000002O33CAAS,0014w00002pQHc1AAG,Went to labcorp 3 times yesterday. They never received my test order.
a2p1U000000RqFRQA0,0011U00000rhwhWQAQ,"Convenient, thorough and friendly"
a2p4w000002O22SAAS,0014w00002pPb1uAAC,Polite and on-time
a2p4w000002O3X2AAK,0014w000031rd9NAAQ,"Very friendly,  and knowledgeable,  very professional"
a2p4w000002KKZqAAO,0011U00000rjfWtQAI,"Fast, friendly, a good deal"
a2p4w000002O31GAAS,0011U00000riGNwQAM,I really appreciate the time the doctor takes with me to make sure everything is addressed that needs to be. I can schedule appointments very easily and there are always appointments available same day or with in a week which is fantastic.
a2p1U000000l8EzQAI,0011U00000rj5KAQAY,Great experience - quick visit and friendly staff!
a2p1U000000RqUBQA0,0011U00000rjW9zQAE,I do not know many friends my age that are in need of care or where XYZ is located by people I know
a2p1U000000RsiMQAS,0011U00000rjMidQAE,Good service
a2p3g000000oeWOAAY,0011U00000rhz7nQAA,You have good Doctors and nurses
a2p1U000000RstrQAC,0011U00000rjvT9QAI,"Liked Dr Roberts, she spent a generous amount of time introducing herself and assessing my health needs"
a2p4w000002O2FWAA0,0014w000031qeMwAAI,"I can only speak to our Clinic in South Bend. Great people who care, lead by a terrific caring Doctor."
a2p3g000000L0SKAA0,0011U00000rk2rxQAA,"I initially had some unfavorable experiences with XYZ (e.g., being encouraged to meet with a doctor who was leaving the Seven Hills location), but I've had positive experiences, too. My contact has been limited, so my endorsement is still conditional."
a2p1U000000RsjpQAC,0011U00000rjkbKQAQ,The team is very responsive and friendly.  It's been an absolute pleasure working with them
a2p1U000000RoX8QAK,0011U00000rjTTmQAM,I like the staff and the care received
a2p1U000000RooZQAS,0011U00000sgzZCQAY,"No deductible, convenient locations, friendly service"
a2p1U000000RojvQAC,0011U00000rjIrnQAE,"Good service, excellent professionals, caring and welcome, but only had one visit so far"
a2p1U000000Rq1YQAS,0011U00000rjSMjQAM,It's free to me
a2p1U000000Rt0QQAS,0011U00000rhxPHQAY,Little or no cost
a2p1U000000RtOyQAK,0011U00000rhxPHQAY,Good patient service. Friendly service
a2p1U000000RodVQAS,0011U00000rjgebQAA,same day appointment. close by work so don't have to miss waiting in pcp waiting room for 40 to 50 mins past appointment time and bankers hours at regular pcp.
a2p1U000000RtHCQA0,0011U00000riuNUQAY,Appointment on time as schedule and they take the time for questions.
a2p1U000000RstcQAC,0011U00000riB3DQAU,It's free through work otherwise I wouldn't go there
a2p1U000000RpQwQAK,0011U00000rj8XbQAI,Sort of disorganized. The receptionist is also the nurse so you wait while she does both duties.
a2p1U000000RpK1QAK,0011U00000ril7dQAA,The one on one personal attention would be the primary reason I will recommend Palladina
a2p1U000000RpYvQAK,0011U00000rizA1QAI,"I received quick and thorough care on my visit, though I did not get all of my needs met at one appointment. I will have to make a second appointment at a separate office to finish getting all of my needs met. Otherwise it was a great visit."
a2p3g000000KzujAAC,0011U00000rishzQAA,"No waiting in office, on time appointments"
a2p1U000000Rou8QAC,0011U00000riql5QAA,They give good service
a2p1U000000l8DVQAY,0011U00000riYE3QAM,"I am still waiting for the results of an abdominal ultrasound,  This is day8.    There is no reason for that o take this long!"
a2p1U000000l8DBQAY,0011U00000riWxnQAE,There are limited appointments and the office doesn't answer the phone regularly.
a2p1U000000RqLPQA0,0011U00000ri55VQAQ,It was quick and easy to get in for an appointment rather than trying to go through all of the PCP's listed on the website to try to find one.
a2p1U000000RoLvQAK,0011U00000rj4FVQAY,Time spent with doctor...no wait for appts
a2p1U000000l8LQQAY,0011U00000ri9XRQAY,Our employer gives us no choice but to come to XYZ or pay a large deductible.  There is no recommendation needed.
a2p3g000000KzvvAAC,0011U00000rjpBTQAY,Una atenciÃ_n  buena por parte de todo el personal
a2p1U000000Rot8QAC,0011U00000sgyyaQAA,The people were great and it is affordable. They're also very accessible
a2p1U000000RoCjQAK,0011U00000rk80OQAQ,"Good experience, short wait time, consult with doctor was thorough."
a2p3g000000KzqOAAS,0011U00000rjbbyQAA,At work great but when retired I'll have to find a new doctor
a2p1U000000RqDVQA0,0011U00000rjOXdQAM,"Just started,  but my experience has been vet good. Excellent  doctor"
a2p3g000000KzDTAA0,0011U00000riGTeQAM,Nurse and Nurse Practitioner were excellent. Sign up and scheduling took forever.
a2p1U000000RonIQAS,0011U00000rif0nQAA,I felt like it was very comprehensive and that I will be getting personalized healthcare with a doctor that will spend time with me.
a2p1U000000RoV0QAK,0011U00000riFVxQAM,It is easy to make an appointment.  There is lot much of a wait time at all to be seen once you get there. The doctors take their time to really try to figure out what's going on with you instead of getting you in and out.  Other staff is very friendly and build good rapport.
a2p4w000002O4duAAC,0014w000031r5x4AAA,Friendly staff always helpful
a2p1U000000RurtQAC,0011U00000ri7kHQAQ,"liked doctor,nurse, receptionist"
a2p3g000000KzEPAA0,0011U00000riytAQAQ,Easy to make appointments and quick service
a2p1U000000RsqOQAS,0011U00000rk2s9QAA,I do not feel a personal expreience
a2p1U000000RoOyQAK,0011U00000rj8XbQAI,Not enough locations. Not enough doctors
a2p1U000000Rp6VQAS,0011U00000rj4xAQAQ,"Your computer entries take way too long now. At my last office visit I saw a nurse, a nurse practitioner and then the doctor. All the same info given 3 times. I like the fact the doctor takes her time with you but sometimes it is a little too long and people are on a time crunch."
a2p1U000000Rt8uQAC,0011U00000riHptQAE,They were very nice
a2p1U000000RplmQAC,0011U00000rk8RfQAI,Time spent with me
a2p1U000000RvGMQA0,0011U00000rk0VvQAI,"Friendly , pleasant and spend time , no rush in and rush out"
a2p1U000000RsRxQAK,0011U00000riWj7QAE,It was nice to be cared for by a small practice.
a2p1U000000Rt3HQAS,0011U00000riYweQAE,"Good first appointment, but too early to form an accurate opinion."
a2p1U000000Ro7fQAC,0011U00000rk8cwQAA,Dr. Lee and Megan are great! Best care team I've had
a2p1U000000RolZQAS,0011U00000risxfQAA,Very easy to get an appointment quickly. Staff is very nice.
a2p1U000000RpW3QAK,0011U00000rjsUVQAY,I felt like I made the doctor uncomfortable.
a2p1U000000Rt0bQAC,0011U00000rhxs6QAA,convenient
a2p1U000000Rp2wQAC,0011U00000rirFtQAI,Unpleased with physician
a2p1U000000Ro9jQAC,0011U00000rjiGqQAI,"not a long wait, easy to make an appointment"
a2p3g000000KzB2AAK,0011U000011h0q8QAA,"Dr. Johnson is awesome and the downtown location is very convenient but I was upset that for some unknown reason, I was marked me as ""ineligible""  and I had to wait three days and multiple phone calls for member services to update my insurance status."
a2p1U000000RsWEQA0,0011U00000rjLoEQAU,"Wasn't organized- had to re-tell my health history because entry was on paper, not electronic. Did not have the medicine the doctor wanted to give as a sample stocked. A blood test was never done that was ordered three months ago and I was not notified."
a2p4w000002O4GMAA0,0014w000031g0a0AAA,"The PA called me (I had a cough so they didn't want me inside) and asked all the questions that should be in my electronic medical records there (medicines, family history, my history, surgeries I've had...) We did a rapid test, which came back negative, but he was insistent that it had something to do with allergies.  If he looked at my file he would have seen that I take a daily antihistamine, well, daily.  So it was really a waste of time and he didn't give me anything to help alleviate this cough."
a2p1U000000Rq0qQAC,0011U00000rjmmbQAA,I have been to many doctors in my lifetime and the new doctor at XYZ made me feel like crap.  My medical info was talked about throughout the entire office- I could hear this from the patient room I was in.  Not a good experience whatsoever.
a2p1U000000RscvQAC,0011U00000rjw2UQAQ,Had to switch Drs.  Dr. Haly is not a good fit for this job.  Dr. Glaser was wonderful so my opinon is defineatly on the up swing.
a2p1U000000RpAxQAK,0011U00000rjXdUQAU,Good service with plenty of time to delve into issues
a2p1U000000RooNQAS,0011U00000rkAYsQAM,"Haven't liked XYZ in the past, but my last visit was much better."
a2p1U000000Rt1CQAS,0011U00000rjtwQQAQ,XYZ is easy to schedule an appointment and always seems to be on time and very efficient.
a2p1U000000RoCpQAK,0011U00000rj9HsQAI,fun and friendly staff very caring
a2p1U000000RqTtQAK,0011U00000rkCBJQA2,"While I like the """"basic idea"""" of the XYZ concept...it really just comes down to whether or not you are comfortable with the physician."
a2p1U000000RpDuQAK,0011U00000rj9jdQAA,good service time well spent
a2p1U000000RogPQAS,0011U00000riNUfQAM,"So far I've had fairly limited experience, but the office visit was great. I got there early but didn't have to spend much time waiting, and spent a good deal of time talking with the doctor. The online support and member service support has been a bit problematic, though, and after several weeks I still don't have access to the online portal, which is a bit of a pain."
a2p1U000000RqS3QAK,0011U00000rj9jdQAA,good care plenty of time with DR.
a2p1U000000RtFiQAK,0011U00000riOAOQA2,My last visit the staff  forgot to call in the prescription.
a2p1U000000Rq0ZQAS,0011U00000ribkZQAQ,The doctor will take time needed to help you. Very friendly and prompt. You do not have to sit for a long period of time before seeing the doctor. The doctor is truly interested in helping you. You are not just a nother number.
a2p1U000000RoIhQAK,0011U00000rjA5OQAU,I felt like the doctor listened to what I was saying.
a2p1U000000RocLQAS,0011U00000rj5skQAA,Physician was a good listener
a2p1U000000Ro8GQAS,0011U00000rjkWSQAY,"Convenient, nice staff"
a2p1U000000RtR4QAK,0011U00000rjEb9QAE,"It's close, convenient, easy to get in.  Doctor is not my preference though and you there aren't lots of choices in doctors."
a2p1U000000RsSJQA0,0011U00000rjt7TQAQ,I like the concept - but it is not proven yet.  My appointment went well - but I was not blown away by the office staff or my actual conversation with my physician
a2p1U000000RtM6QAK,0011U00000rie4RQAQ,"I WAS TAKEN CARE IN A VERY PROFESSIONAL MANNER. MY ONLY CONCERN WAS AFTER I WAS SENT OUT FOR XRAYS, I CALLED BACK FOR THE RESULTS. I WAS TOLD I HAD A BROKEN TOE NOT TOLD WHICH ONE. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO WEAR A BOOT BUT HAD TO ASK HOW LONG. I WAS NOT TOLD OF ANY FOLLOW  UP NEEDED UNTIL I RECIEVED A PHONE CALL THE NEXT WEEK TO GO IN FOR ANOTHER XRAY TO SEE PROGRESS OF HEALING. I FEEL THAT THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE SHARED AT THE TIME OF TREATMENT. I FEEL I WAS LEFT IN A GUESSING GAME FOR WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR FOLLOW UP AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS."
a2p1U000000RqViQAK,0011U00000riCjyQAE,"I am pleased so far, however other people's health care choices are a private matter."
a2p1U000000RqT1QAK,0011U00000rjtiAQAQ,"I went in for a annual physical, I was told I would receive my blood test results but it has been a Month and still I have not heard back.  I had to look up the results myself on the portal."
a2p1U000000Rsu7QAC,0011U00000rjIhsQAE,Friendly and professional.
a2p1U000000RqBMQA0,0011U00000rkCBWQA2,"Took a few weeks to get in, thats to long!"
a2p1U000000RoLlQAK,0011U00000rhw2cQAA,Not sure about the concept yet and the people and technology don't seem to be comparable as to appointments and instructions
a2p3g000000qcqXAAQ,0011U00000riqQkQAI,I call you Friday and you same Monday I had a weekend of pain
a2p4w000001pkLoAAI,0013g000006tfz6AAA,So far its very convenient
a2p4w000002Jp3PAAS,0011U000011hqpTQAQ,Good timely service
a2p4w000001pnLNAAY,0011U00000rin6tQAA,Just seems like so changes with this place but seems to have more help so hopefully they will improve
a2p4w000002K6syAAC,0011U00000rjabmQAA,Very thorough! New nurse is pleasant and efficient.
a2p3g000000qNtDAAU,0013g000006OQAHAA4,"The entire staff from the individual I scheduled my appointment with to the MA's, Dr. Curtis and his assistance are very pleasant, knowledgeable, eager to help and easy to talk to.  Thank you."
a2p3g000000qXYFAA2,0011U00000rhrBiQAI,Availability is limited. Ongoing chronic problem with very little relief and no email for doctors to get paperwork or fill it out. No one should need to drive to the office to hand over papers and then it be closed at 4 even though hours say open until 6. Especially when a patient is experiencing pain.
a2p4w000001pqx0AAA,0011U00000rjrmLQAQ,No cost to me.
a2p4w000002JtUPAA0,0011U00000rjmSFQAY,"Primary doctor left, can not get any information on where she went, the new doctor that was assigned to me was absolutely terrible. I will not return, my son and husband will continue to  go to Dr. Boyer and Dr. Gorman but I will not be returning."
a2p4w000002K2cXAAS,0013g00000KUP7wAAH,The doctor was very friendly and very thorough she explained everything I think she's going to be an absolutely wonderful doctor for me in the future
a2p4w000001q0vTAAQ,0011U00000rjnM7QAI,easy to access and well priced.  Good quality if healthy
a2p4w000002Jp3jAAC,0011U00000riLTXQA2,"Low cost, convenient multiple locations. Did not like virtual platform"
a2p3g000000qPlQAAU,0013g00000HWYTVAA5,Nice
a2p4w000002JuRgAAK,0011U00000rjbyxQAA,"XYZ is the best primary care I've ever received. I love the doctors, and the clinics are convenient."
a2p3g000000qZdzAAE,0011U00000rk100QAA,"I haven't been going there too long, but what I have experienced so far, I would probably recommend."
a2p4w000002JmqsAAC,0011U00000riCAgQAM,"HELPFUL, SUPPORTIVE, RESPECTFUL, PERSONALIZED HEALTH CARE"
a2p4w000002K7wmAAC,0011U00000rjJK7QAM,I have been very pleased with my health care
a2p4w000001ptRlAAI,0011U00000rhw4NQAQ,"Appointments are easy and fast, and communication is easy."
a2p3g000000qhtCAAQ,0011U00000riz01QAA,Convenient and saves money
a2p1U000000RpEEQA0,0011U00000riSzEQAU,"Fast friendly, nice atmosphere."
a2p1U000000RqNzQAK,0011U00000rhwPrQAI,Dr. Shurek listens to his patients. he is the third doctor ive seen. the other two took an xray said yep your hip is gone take advil call us in 10 years and find another career. not Dr. Ed he referred me to paladena health and we now have a plan to replace my hip so i can have quality of life without constand pain. HE CARES about his patients and relly listens. He is not just in it for the money he is a real Doctor that cares about helping people. Im anxious to see ifhis services are open to the public soon so i can get my son and grandson signed up w/him.I finally feel after all the years of looking  that i found a doctor worth keeping. He's the best!  cudos to paladena for looking to Iowa for such a great guy!
a2p1U000000Rp8CQAS,0011U00000rjcbPQAQ,I like that it's easy to schedule appointments and that I am able to make my appointments right at work.
a2p1U000000RoCfQAK,0011U00000rj9jdQAA,Great service and time spent with a Doctor
a2p1U000000RpTGQA0,0011U00000riLA6QAM,"I like the XYZ model (concierge medicine) very much, but now my doctor is leaving, which makes it feel more like Kaiser.  Also, I can't imagine her going unless something were wrong organizationally, so I'm hesitant to recommend it to anyone else."
a2p1U000000RpPdQAK,0011U00000rjrbDQAQ,Good doctor and nurse....easy access when open
a2p3g000000KzCWAA0,0011U00000riCQUQA2,The nurse and the doctor made me feel very comfortable.
a2p1U000000Rt5eQAC,0011U00000riNSFQA2,"Good so far, but I've only had one visit so far."
a2p3g000000KzBKAA0,0011U00000rjjf8QAA,This time it was easy getting in to see the Dr. It is not always this way
a2p1U000000Rsh3QAC,0011U00000riJ3xQAE,Very nice and low stress environment
a2p1U000000RqU0QAK,0011U00000rhto9QAA,Dr Sureck took the time I need to give a very complete physical.
a2p1U000000RvDSQA0,0011U00000rhyAvQAI,"I had a doctor from XYZ years ago that set a high standard and really understood """"family"""" medicine. He is gone now and I have yet to find a doctor in XYZ that makes me feel like I matter."
a2p1U000000RtQUQA0,0011U00000rjEDLQA2,Its a very hands on type doctors office that helps
a2p1U000000RvBvQAK,0011U00000riRHmQAM,"It's a good benefit because there is no co-pay and you're supposed to be able to reach your physician 24/7 by phone. At first I LOVED XYZ. I had a physician I was comfortable with and who made an effort to get to know me.  I am not so happy with it now that I have had three different """"PCPs"""" in four years.  It's been impossible to develop a relationship with my doctor or the office staff.  I see/talk to someone different every time I call or schedule an appointment.  I would prefer having a PCP who knows me and an office staff that does as well.  I don't feel secure with XYZ because of the frequent turnover of physicians and office staff.  I also have serious doubts regarding the competence of the office staff since the last time the person drew blood for labs she left it on the counter over the weekend and neglected to send it in to the lab.  I had to go back and have my blood drawn a second time."
a2p3g000000KzCsAAK,0011U00000rjJH5QAM,Most are friendly.  Thorough medical staff.
a2p3g000000KyoDAAS,0011U00000ritnoQAA,My appointment  was same day
a2p1U000000RqCyQAK,0011U00000rjlZWQAY,Dr. Song was extremely personable and helped accommodate my needs while trying to help my recovery.
a2p1U000000RtAdQAK,0011U00000rjzySQAQ,"I've had 2 or more diagnosed sinus infections per year for almost 20 years; treated with OTC decongestant AND an antibiotic. I only scheduled the appointment to get the antibiotic. I knew what I had when I showed up for the appointment, and it was confirmed by the medical professionals. It is the first time in 20 years that the doctor/NP I'm dealing with refused to issue an antibiotic for me. I saw an NP at a Little Clinic facility after work, again confirmed diagnosis of sinus infection, and was issued a prescription for the antibiotic I needed. I paid XYZ $40 for a diagnosis I already knew walking in, and walked away with nothing. I don't see that happenning again, only because I will not utilize XYZ when I have my next sinus infection."
a2p1U000000RqGhQAK,0011U00000riAkvQAE,Doctor always try to keep costs down and the time spent discussing my concerns.
a2p1U000000RosbQAC,0011U00000rjvT9QAI,Docs are good and ease of scheduling is an asset
a2p1U000000RpZfQAK,0011U00000rjheFQAQ,"Nice, friendly environment with good service."
a2p1U000000RplGQAS,0011U00000rjJxAQAU,The only issue I usually have is making appointments. There is no easy way to make or change appointments other than online. Humana's default ie version doesn't support the online portal for making appointments and everytime you visit the clinic in person you are asked to schedule the appointment online which means I have to use my phone and the appointment interface is not as phone friendly.
a2p1U000000Rp80QAC,0011U00000rjvniQAA,I followed up 3 times with XYZ on 10/22/2018 for my scheduled appointment of 10/23/2018 but I was told there was no appointment scheduled for 10/23/2018. Hence this survey is redundant.
a2p3g000000owMVAAY,0011U00000ri6OGQAY,"Fast, friendly service.  No muss, no fuss.  All my questions answered and my issues treated.  Having to go elsewhere for X-Rays was not convenient!"
a2p3g000000ozCkAAI,0011U00000riGJrQAM,They act on what you are there for and go out there way to ask for more issues.
a2p3g000000ov51AAA,0011U00000rjlJ6QAI,I am still trying to figure out how my new insurance (Cigna) works through Trail Head clinic or palladina and lack of application of payment to my deductible if it is through trailhead contracts versus Cigna/Palladina contracts.
a2p3g000000oyMPAAY,0011U000019xysBQAQ,"Friendly staff, easy to get in for an appointment"
a2p3g000000pfaJAAQ,0011U00000rjPbzQAE,I have been going there since they opened up. My doctor was retiring and I felt this was a great move for me. Nice to have choices to go to any of thier clinics. The Doctors and staff show they really care.
a2p3g000000owNKAAY,0011U00000rhxZDQAY,Easy to get appointments.  Good care.
a2p3g000000oyI8AAI,0011U00000riZb5QAE,"The service and patient care excellent and I was treated very well. My only concern, which I confirmed during my visit yesterday, was that if I leave UCAR, either for a new position or retirement, I would become a retail ""patient"", meaning either find a new doctor or pay a monthly fee upwards of $70. I liked Dr. Malfese and would prefer to build up a patient history with him, but I'm within a couple of years of retirement and that the fee may be beyond my fixed-income means at that point. I would recommend XYZ to a younger career person but I'm not sure I would recommend this type of care plan to someone else in my situation."
a2p3g000000pxPsAAI,0011U00000riZXzQAM,"Can't get use to same doctor.  I plan on finding a new primary doctor.  Since I've been going to XYZ,  4th new doctor.  Haven't been going long.  Once you get use to one person, they leave."
a2p3g000000ouCGAAY,0011U00000rj6taQAA,Friendly and communicative. Service from my pcp Is thorough and trustworthy.
a2p3g000000pkkEAAQ,0011U00000rjw79QAA,The doctor in the Puyallup clinic really paid
a2p3g000000pM4JAAU,0011U00000riQzpQAE,"They told me I would get prescribed for blood pressure medications I had to take to maintain my health, and failed to give me the prescriptions. Very sickening thing to think a doctor would trick me like that."
a2p3g000000owNHAAY,0011U00000rjm6nQAA,"The staff is committed to respect one's time and the appointment time, so there is little to no waiting. The staff is professional yet friendly and welcoming. And they handle the situation at hand."
a2p3g000000puadAAA,0011U00000rhxYqQAI,Convenience; Friendly; Profressional
a2p3g000000pRMmAAM,0011U00000rimQrQAI,Friendly staff
a2p3g000000p4NlAAI,0011U000019xycDQAQ,"Service has always been fast and professional.  I only scored it an 8 because when I was there for an annual physical, some lab work was ordered that wasn't covered under my insurance and trying to figure that out was a surprise and a pain."
a2p3g000000pYtTAAU,0011U00000rjlZMQAY,I needed a COVID test and was referred somewhere else. Most of my co-workers were tested by their doctor immediately. I had to wait days to find an opening at CVS.
a2p3g000000ovDKAAY,0013g000004Gj5SAAS,"Small office, not too many useless staff. Quick access with my insurance."
a2p3g000000pxO1AAI,0011U00000rj7fsQAA,Telehealth visit with MD went great.
a2p3g000000oyHZAAY,0013g000006thN5AAI,"The connection on the virtual visit was often poor, but the doctor was friendly and listened."
a2p3g000000pEvZAAU,0011U000019xyjUQAQ,I like that my district has provided this as a health benefit
a2p3g000000pTA4AAM,0011U00000rjeK6QAI,"Appeared safe, clean, Doc Curtis spent satisfactory time addressing my concerns."
a2p3g000000owKyAAI,0011U000011En8fQAC,If they were on the same EHR then everything would be great.  I had 3 consults recently and note of them where in my XYZ chart and the consults could not see what XYZ had done so test so no one has the full picture.
a2p3g000000pQQsAAM,0011U00000riry7QAA,"Convenient, cost is included in health insurance, good way to establish and keep a baseline of health information."
a2p3g000000pP2GAAU,0011U00000rjYVNQA2,Part of MPFD. All friends already go there
a2p3g000000ph90AAA,0011U00000riozrQAA,Had some scheduling mixups requiring 2 drives to the clinic. The interaction with the PCP however was greate.
a2p3g000000pirDAAQ,0011U00000rjdC7QAI,"Great providers, flexibility, and quick response times."
a2p1U000000Rsu0QAC,0011U00000riHDKQA2,Availability and access
a2p1U000000RqeOQAS,0011U00000riiwYQAQ,"Well my daughter has had a dry cough for quiete awhile. We were told to being her in so we did and dr spent 2 mins, listened to lungs said she's fine and sent us on our way."
a2p1U000000Rt6RQAS,0011U00000riHDKQA2,Convenient and they did a thorough examination
a2p3g000000LAd1AAG,0011U00000rhpVMQAY,Most of the time they do a good job
a2p1U000000RszfQAC,0011U00000rjx2TQAQ,Dr. is great
a2p1U000000Rq3OQAS,0011U00000rhuhQQAQ,No.
a2p1U000000RpRCQA0,0011U00000rjIciQAE,"Sometimes its hard to get ahold of the doctor,"
a2p1U000000RpLKQA0,0011U00000rjGDPQA2,"Much quicker to get an appointment than other physician offices, spend actual time listening to the patient's needs, conveniently located near my place of work, only downside is that I cannot recommend to anyone since XYZ is only available to employees of employers who buy in to the plan"
a2p1U000000RtJVQA0,0011U00000riBtPQAU,The appointment took a very long time--nearly an hour. This seems like a lot for an on-site clinic that is supposed to make it easier and quicker to get care.
a2p1U000000Rt0IQAS,0011U00000rjptLQAQ,I like my doctor and I appreciated the fact that she kept in contact with me via email.
a2p1U000000Rp8tQAC,0011U00000ri2ikQAA,Dr. turnover has been a major issue
a2p3g000000KylSAAS,0011U00000rjDD0QAM,Not sure about the Doctor but the Administrative staff was great!
a2p1U000000RqHhQAK,0011U00000rikC5QAI,I really like the no waiting. I come in and I'm seen within minutes. I'm building a relationship with the doctor and I feel that she is compassionate.
a2p1U000000RpuHQAS,0011U00000rjPbeQAE,Convenient
a2p1U000000RqAgQAK,0011U00000rjXz8QAE,Having little to no copay is great and they really try to look at your overall health and make suggestions in several areas that could help you instead of just focusing on one at a time.
a2p1U000000Rsx3QAC,0011U00000rjmXnQAI,Was able to use the telemedicine service which was nice.
a2p3g000000L2PYAA0,0011U00000rjXyuQAE,I was very unhappy with the communication after my last 'visit'  I drove 93 miles to be in town and didn't know it was a virtual call until I was in the car driving to the Drs office.  Then I get a call at 11:38 to answer questions before the meeting that was supposed to start at 11:30.  Very unorganized and very poor communication.
a2p1U000000RpQoQAK,0011U00000riXJjQAM,I like the ability to see my doctor when I need to ant the location of my choice.
a2p1U000000RqQLQA0,0011U00000rjC3DQAU,"Please don't send surveys after my appts.  If I am unhappy, I will discuss that with my Arvada office.  Thank you."
a2p1U000000RphgQAC,0011U00000rkD1HQAU,I don't like how Dr Brone talks down to you. Also was told that I messed up when scheduling online.
a2p1U000000Rpi4QAC,0011U00000riWPgQAM,Great Dr never received my test results
a2p1U000000RqfIQAS,0011U00000riJ1XQAU,great service.  need at least one early morning start day and one late night for working people
a2p1U000000RoWjQAK,0011U00000riR0tQAE,"It was quick and easy, location was a plus."
a2p1U000000RpBlQAK,0011U00000rjQabQAE,Convenient as a State employee. Not sure how it is in the private sector.
a2p1U000000RqU6QAK,0011U00000rjRjVQAU,Because it's fast and easy
a2p1U000000RtQYQA0,0011U00000riyXrQAI,My issue was not resolved. I went in on a wednesday with sinus isues. Was told to take Antihitamines and decongestants. Was told if it didn't get better to call back the following Monday. I did that this morning and all that the DR wanted to prescribe was more decongestants and Antihistamines which i have been taking since the first visit but never got any better. Now I have to go to another immediate care center after work to get an antibiotic since I have gotten worse.
a2p1U000000Rt2CQAS,0011U00000rjNzjQAE,It was my first visit. It was good.
a2p1U000000RvHZQA0,0011U00000rjXzRQAU,Eh...everyone has different insurance.
a2p1U000000RpOkQAK,0011U00000rhxu7QAA,"The service is convenient. I did not give it a 10 because I've tried to make an appointment both in person and over the phone in the past, and the place has been closed during regular business hours or no call back."
a2p1U000000RodBQAS,0011U00000rix5ZQAQ,"I am still pretty new, so waiting to see how this goes!"
a2p1U000000RqcbQAC,0011U00000riNHVQA2,Convenience
a2p1U000000RtTxQAK,0011U00000rjNbOQAU,Great service but almost always takes more than a couple days to get into the office.
a2p1U000000Rot5QAC,0011U00000rk4ksQAA,"Went in to have eye checked for possible corneal abrasion.   When they got the kit to check, they realized they did not have the stain necessary to do so.  Since the only kit they had was the incomplete kit, it was a waste of time to go in. They said they did not know when the supplies would be in. Needed to make arrangements to get help elsewhere.   Did not offer the service/care promised in the timely fashion promised when XYZ services were pitched to us."
a2p1U000000RvEmQAK,0011U00000rj9jdQAA,good service plenty of time with the doctor
a2p1U000000Rp06QAC,0011U00000rihbBQAQ,"Kattie is so easy to talk to you, she listens and really cares for her patients"
a2p1U000000RpsiQAC,0011U00000rjZGwQAM,I like my primary care doctor.
a2p1U000000RsjiQAC,0011U00000riCnbQAE,"This basic and professional primary care experience is amazing. Only detractor is it's connected to my insurance company, and I would have to change providers if I change insurance."
a2p1U000000RpS4QAK,0011U00000rk0H3QAI,Convenience
a2p1U000000Ruv1QAC,0011U00000rii9rQAA,"If the opportunity arose I would recommend it, however I don't see myself going out of my way to tell people."
a2p1U000000RpkMQAS,0011U00000rkCqmQAE,It's convenient and the staff is helpful.
a2p1U000000RoD0QAK,0011U00000rilVCQAY,Nice having enough time to talk with the staff and doctor.  I felt like doctor really wanted me to work through any issues I was having.
a2p1U000000RoUVQA0,0011U00000rjAmNQAU,You gave me all the time sI needed to talk about my health history
a2p1U000000Rq7FQAS,0011U00000riqkrQAA,Everything was pretty great. It was overall a pretty good experience but I wouldn't say it was the best.
a2p3g000000KysEAAS,0011U00000rhx8gQAA,great personal service
a2p1U000000Rq54QAC,0011U00000rijeJQAQ,I get free office visits.  That is HUGE
a2p1U000000RosdQAC,0011U00000rid5OQAQ,My situation is unique and a serious medical problem was not addressed at the time of my visit.
a2p3g000000KysxAAC,0011U00000rinr3QAA,"Location, low to no cost, peers recommendations and their satisfaction, take advantage of State employees benefit"
a2p1U000000RsygQAC,0011U00000ri8cnQAA,"I really like the convenience, but referrals take way too long."
a2p1U000000Rpg8QAC,0011U00000riPVdQAM,Office isn't always open in Canon City.
a2p1U000000RszMQAS,0011U00000rhzSDQAY,"Had a long wait time and my questions were answered with an """"i don't know""""   I left feeling confused and sad this was my option for primary care."
a2p1U000000RtSZQA0,0011U00000riZYXQA2,"If someone is frustrated with the ability to get care in a timely matter, I would suggest XYZ."
a2p1U000000RuwYQAS,0011U00000rj8pAQAQ,The service was good and timely
a2p1U000000RqfUQAS,0011U00000rk80NQAQ,"While the staff was friendly I was unable to accomplish the point of my visit, to get a flu shot. My chart says I'm pregnant and they've seen me already this year. After arriving I was told they need a different type of release form and didn't even have the specific shot required for a pregnant woman in stock. Overall a friendly experience and a waste of my time."
a2p1U000000RsRiQAK,0011U00000rjkbKQAQ,I had a great experience (from scheduling the meeting through leaving after the appointment).  Thank you.
a2p1U000000Rt1uQAC,0011U00000riDPNQA2,"Great customer service experience, personable staffing"
a2p3g000000oRmEAAU,0011U00000riRfNQAU,Appt was fast and efficient
a2p1U000000Rqb7QAC,0011U00000rhtC6QAI,"Overall, I liked the unique approach to healthcare. The doctor took a lot of time to explain things to me, and gave me a lot of tips. The person at the front desk greeted me VERY briefly, and had me wait 2-3 minutes until she was finished typing something on the computer. That's not the type of greeting and attention you usually get when you have an appointment somewhere- I felt like I was interrupting her!"
a2p1U000000Rsb8QAC,0011U00000rk0WBQAY,Dr & RN very professional. Was seen on time
a2p3g000000LAd6AAG,0011U00000ri7xeQAA,Excellent service not crowded
a2p1U000000RpLhQAK,0011U00000rhsYfQAI,"Dr. Carter is excellent. If she is available, I would recommend her in a heartbeat."
a2p4w000002O454AAC,0011U00000riFWeQAM,It’s very easy to get in touch with your provider. And Dr Song-Nicholes is the best!
a2p3g000000KzKAAA0,0011U00000riDPBQA2,I liked it there.
a2p1U000000Rp4pQAC,0011U00000rizVfQAI,very friendly and very organized
a2p1U000000RtJZQA0,0011U00000rhqufQAA,"I love my care provider - Ashley Giles.  She really takes the time to hear me and my concerns, and never makes me feel rushed.  She explains things thoroughly and I feel much more educated when I'm finished with my appointment."
a2p1U000000RscCQAS,0011U00000ri0eLQAQ,OFFERED THROUGH WORK ONLY DURING A SIGN UP PERIOD
a2p1U000000RsvnQAC,0011U00000rk3mYQAQ,Ease of access and use. Personal attention.
a2p1U000000RowKQAS,0011U00000rjwb4QAA,"Welcoming environment in the clinic, great conversation with the MA who checked me in and the doctor. But I don't generally recommend products/services that I can't or my friends can't self select."
a2p1U000000RpXKQA0,0011U00000rixQCQAY,The appointment was very thorough and informative. All my questions were answered.
a2p1U000000RptuQAC,0011U00000rk6QAQAY,"personalized care, friendly staff, they care"
a2p1U000000RsXwQAK,0011U00000sgywIQAQ,"Very little wait, Doctor spent her time and was very friendly and knowledgeable."
a2p1U000000Rt7MQAS,0011U00000rhxrfQAA,"Personal attention; Can """"get in"""" to see the doctor quickly."
a2p1U000000RodiQAC,0011U00000rjawuQAA,quick curtious easy appointment
a2p3g000000pzZuAAI,0011U00000rk683QAA,It is convenient to go in and get most of the tests needed. The staff is very friendly and takes time to answer my questions.
a2p3g000000qIxDAAU,0013g00000CyYW2AAN,Great customer service and listening practices
a2p3g000000q5XMAAY,0011U00000rj5fHQAQ,Because is good service
a2p3g000000pzbRAAQ,0011U00000rifuqQAA,"fast service, no waiting"
a2p1U000000RoHzQAK,0011U00000rjaFdQAI,Was very inconvenient to have to travel to a second location for x-rays
a2p1U000000Ro7rQAC,0011U00000ri2ikQAA,"Inexpensive, easy access, but revolving door physicians"
a2p1U000000RqHzQAK,0011U00000rikWcQAI,I don't have a choice in doctors
a2p1U000000RsvjQAC,0011U00000rhxZFQAY,It was fine
a2p3g000000pwxtAAA,0011U00000riPTmQAM,Dr. McCay is great!
a2p1U000000RqS8QAK,0011U00000rjqqkQAA,Convenient location; quick appointments usually.
a2p1U000000RoTjQAK,0011U00000riBXIQA2,"Convenience, easy to get in for same day appts."
a2p3g000000qH05AAE,0013g00000CyYOzAAN,Different than other doctor experiences
a2p3g000000qA66AAE,0011U00000rjQabQAE,I get it for free as a State Employee. I don't know if I would pay an extra fee for it.
a2p3g000000q1XXAAY,0011U00000rjB4nQAE,"Local, friendly, easy to access, a good option for everyday ailments or begin researching an issue.  I like working on health with natural remedies, and that is what is missing for me sometimes - someone to compare notes with on natural methods of healing."
a2p3g000000qNqxAAE,0013g00000Bm9OcAAJ,Made me feel super comfortable and very caring. It was an awesome experience. Especially the one on one and attention given. For the first time I felt comfortable.
a2p3g000000oeYiAAI,0011U00000riFWVQA2,"i like XYZ. i like my doctor, Dr. Bernardy. The response on the latest issue I had took a couple days to hear back about. That was a little disappointing."
a2p3g000000oRcKAAU,0011U00000rjPfeQAE,XYZ is terribly convenient. Same day service for emergencies.
a2p1U000000RqQdQAK,0011U00000riHvoQAE,Friendly staff.  They actually talk to you.
a2p1U000000RoS6QAK,0011U00000rin5eQAA,Friendly
a2p1U000000RqKTQA0,0011U00000rjeK6QAI,Convenient scheduling.
a2p1U000000Rp3OQAS,0011U00000rjJHrQAM,"The staff at XYZ at the Tacoma location are very friendly, courteous and accommodating. Also Dr. Cook takes the time to not only check how you're doing Medically but also personally."
a2p1U000000Ro4wQAC,0011U00000rjDoCQAU,Came in 10 min early for first appointment. Filled paperwork and still had to wait 30 min to see the doctor. Follow up was also subpar. After missing his call he said he would try later to call back. Never called and finally recieved a letter 2 weeks later with my bloodwork. No followup on what the numbers mean or if I should do a follow up appointment.
a2p1U000000RpeKQAS,0011U00000riEfaQAE,"I'm not happy with current doctors , NP. Not taking time to listen , and then not reading my chart to know my health problems , then giving the wrong diagnosis because they didn't read my chart and history"
a2p3g000000KzAyAAK,0011U00000rjJDqQAM,Very convenient and easy to schedule appointments.  Very friendly doctors.
a2p1U000000RpmCQAS,0011U00000rjNznQAE,I like Dr. John.  He listens and doesn't make me feel rushed.  I also like the idea of XYZ.  I don't have to weigh whether I am sick enough to justify the time and cost.
a2p1U000000Ro9BQAS,0011U00000rhwjtQAA,"Convenient, easy to get appointments."
a2p1U000000RpnZQAS,0011U00000rj9g5QAA,It appears that the office is more of a wellness and not necessarily for an illness  or injury
a2p1U000000RsgIQAS,0011U00000rjUPoQAM,I was taken back within a few minutes of arriving. I was greeted with a smile and the staff were very nice.
a2p1U000000Rsr2QAC,0011U00000rj5kUQAQ,"Quick, convenient, consistent experience"
a2p1U000000Rp6NQAS,0011U00000ritTaQAI,very nice staff and doctor

a2p1U000000Ro6wQAC,0011U00000riAbtQAE,"Save money, convenient"
a2p1U000000RoCPQA0,0011U00000riX0sQAE,The doctor's approach is most welcoming. It's difficult to find a physician who takes any extra time to learn their patients instead of offering quickly determined solutions.
a2p1U000000RsbwQAC,0011U00000rhzPiQAI,Great customer service and nice people.
a2p1U000000RtPFQA0,0011U00000rhrIkQAI,"I was told eveything wrong with me with no treatment, I was told if I felt the same way 2 days later to call back for meds which I have yet to receive!!!!"
a2p1U000000RvENQA0,0011U00000rhvUsQAI,You do not take walkins for the Lville area.  I tried to do a walkin and was told appt only
a2p1U000000Rpu6QAC,0011U00000rk1ykQAA,Dr. John and the nurse are very helpful and friendly
a2p3g000000KymBAAS,0011U00000ripG7QAI,?
a2p1U000000RsXtQAK,0011U00000riVXTQA2,Felt at ease and was impressed with how much time the staff spent with me
a2p1U000000RsnBQAS,0011U00000rjbcVQAQ,"The Health and Well-being Center is still transitioning to new staff and computer systems right now. My experience on 1/14 wasn't the best experience but it is understandable due to all of the issues with the computer systems. I would recommend the center to someone that really needed to see a physician but I would tell others to wait until all of the issues have been worked out, if possible."
a2p1U000000RosEQAS,0011U00000ri9zyQAA,Fast and friendly service
a2p1U000000RtFZQA0,0011U00000rj3x3QAA,Very concientious and caring staff.
a2p1U000000RpgqQAC,0011U00000rhw47QAA,Dr is very nice. On time appointment. Less waiting.
a2p1U000000Rp35QAC,0011U00000rhxFrQAI,Very accessible and convenient. Don't have a ton of faith in the quality of the medical advice / services I've been given
a2p4w000002O4CAAA0,0014w00002pPasbAAC,"Difficult to get an appointment (they are booked too far out) and the last appointment I had for a severe allergy, I was only told to put coconut oil on the itchy areas.  I ended up in Urgent Care two days later."
a2p4w000002KHc3AAG,0011U00000rjAOnQAM,"I was told I would be checked in, but then told to sit down and I wasn't sure if I was checked in. Dr's were running late, per usual for XYZ/XYZ. At least not an hour late this time."
a2p4w000002NyqTAAS,0011U00000rjFsKQAU,Convenient and doctors take time to talk with you and actually respond to emails and messages
a2p4w000002O2IaAAK,0014w000031qZqJAAU,"Very attentive to your needs, takes time to listen."
a2p4w000002K2UsAAK,0011U00000rhxGWQAY,Friendly and attentive staff
a2p4w000002KJXPAA4,0011U00000rjM32QAE,I like the service but I am not happy with all the turnover of staff.
a2p4w000002KJ77AAG,0011U00000rk0H3QAI,Very personable.
a2p4w000002KIFKAA4,0013g000004Gj8YAAS,"Love my Dr, not loving the change from XYZ to XYZ. Hopefully you can get your website updated so I can find basic info like locations online instead of having to call."
a2p4w000002Nz25AAC,0014w000031g1goAAA,Everyone was great
a2p4w000002NzpvAAC,0011U00000rk7AiQAI,"My first experiences with the clinic were great, however, yesterday things didn't go well.  I had made my appointment several months ago with Megan Montecalvo.  When I was on my way to the clinic I received a phone call indicating that she was running late. I didn't have any problem with it, but when I got to the Belmar clinic I was informed that she didn't work there anymore, that she only goes to the Arvada clinic.  I hadn't been informed about this.  When I spoke to Savanah to inform her that I wasn't able to go to the Arvada clinic, and asked how come no one had told me about the change she responded that I had received emails and text messages for the confirmation, which was true, but they never referred to any change of clinic.  Belmar didn't have me on their schedule and furthermore, when I checked the confirmation email and text message they confirmed for Belmar, there was a change in the name of the care provider that I saw when I read the message carefully, but Belmar didn't have me scheduled with Dr. Nguyen.  Maria was very helpful and arranged for me to be seen by Dr. Nguyen.  The appointment was ok, but I wasn't pleased with the confusion and I had already developed a relationship with Dr. Montecalvo and was expecting to see her."
a2p4w000002NzmXAAS,0011U000017HPymQAG,"Ever since ""XYZ Health"" was bought out by XYZ, I have had nothing but problems. Either something with the website doesn't work, my PCP is not available or has very limited hours to see patients (when I am looking to go to the doctor, I used to be able to make an appointment for same day or at the very least the next day - not the next week). The staff (MAs specifically) are rude and can't even pronounce medications much less know what they are for, so I don't have faith in really anything they're doing, and the PCPs don't actually listen to you like they used to. Now it's just ""standard of care"" rather than taking the time to get to the root of an issue, or perhaps doing something unconventional because the person knows their body the best."
a2p4w000002NzCjAAK,0013g000006thK6AAI,"I had a good experience, but I was not happy that the provider refused an antigen test for me.  I shouldn't be refused any test that I am willing to pay for."
a2p4w000002NyxeAAC,0014w00002pQGOqAAO,The staff was very polite & the provider was professional and helpful.
a2p4w000002O0WzAAK,0011U00000riaoNQAQ,Good listener
a2p4w000002NzyTAAS,0011U00000rjl5LQAQ,No wait time.
a2p4w000002K3dgAAC,0013g000006tf44AAA,It was fast and easy
a2p4w000002KAHXAA4,0011U00000rjddbQAA,Inviting atmosphere and awesome staff.  I was able to get lab work too!
a2p4w000002Nz4pAAC,0014w00002pQKMuAAO,Dr wagner asks questions irrelevant to the medical conditions...she does not care for patients
a2p4w000002NyWTAA0,0014w00002pQLyCAAW,"It’s okay. They tell me to arrive 15 minutes before my schedule appointment and no one was there. 
When the gentleman pulled up, he told me to give him a moment to setup."
a2p4w000002NyitAAC,0011U00000rifvBQAQ,everyone is nice
a2p4w000002NzEaAAK,0014w00002pQ07UAAS,Good Knowledgeable friendly service and I did not have to wait a long time.

a2p4w000002NzVgAAK,0011U00000rhtqGQAQ,I haven't met my new doctor.
a2p4w000002NyHdAAK,0013g000006tg3SAAQ,seem to care about my wants rather then just keeping me going to doctor
a2p4w000002KGy8AAG,0011U00000rjNzoQAE,Good service without rushing
a2p4w000002NzQ7AAK,0011U00000rjz6kQAA,"Quick, friendly, and effective."
a2p4w000002NyVLAA0,0014w00002pPb2LAAS,had to fill out a questionnaire that was not even looked at by neither nurse nor doctor. It sat on the counter my whole visit and was still there when I walked out.
a2p4w000002O4dzAAC,0014w000031qnUWAAY,You get good service when you go.  But getting an actual appt and seeing them .  You can only make phone or video calls if you are sick is ridiculous.
a2p1U000000RoBXQA0,0011U00000rjXS6QAM,I am not getting the services that I need and I don't get any follow up from my doctor
a2p4w000002KKbXAAW,0011U00000rj5fHQAQ,"Good Doctors,"
a2p3g000000owPfAAI,0011U00000riXbDQAU,1. Cost  2. Length of visit  3. Over the phone visits  4.Helpful staff  5. Cost
a2p1U000000RsrtQAC,0011U00000rif0zQAA,It was a relatively in-depth and pleasant visit.  I felt like Dr. Snyder was really focused on me.
a2p1U000000RogaQAC,0011U00000rjtiPQAQ,I don't know enough yet. This was my first visit.
a2p1U000000l8FsQAI,0011U00000riF02QAE,"The staff is confident, friendly, and timely.  I also believe them to be very thorough."
a2p1U000000Rp3TQAS,0011U00000rj2hqQAA,I like the flexibility as well as I can always see the same DR.
a2p1U000000Ro9uQAC,0011U00000rjd8pQAA,Only had 1 appointment so far. Cannot give an honest review until a few more appointments.
a2p1U000000RpUxQAK,0011U00000rjw79QAA,I did not feel I was taken seriously with my health issues and even got laughed at when I was talking about my issues..
a2p3g000000qdpaAAA,0011U00000rjBwUQAU,Convenient and on time appointments
a2p3g000000owPqAAI,0011U00000rjw4UQAQ,"Friendly, fast, easy to find."

a2p1U000000RsTJQA0,0011U00000riaoAQAQ,"I have been impressed with the concept of XYZ and I like Dr Cameron. He is kind and approachable.  I am still just a tad bit sceptical.  I'm not a fan of the status quo in medicine, and haven't seen a trend toward improvement in just about anything so indulge my caution.  Thanks â˜º"
a2p3g000000KyvLAAS,0011U0000125JT1QAM,Everyone is nice and the doctor seems to know a lot
a2p1U000000RpZLQA0,0011U00000rhtWqQAI,I don't feel that I'm getting good care from XYZ.  Good thing it's free because I would be unhappy if I paid for a visit just to be told to take ibuprofen.
a2p1U000000RqIrQAK,0011U00000rilHzQAI,"They are pretty new and they will, I am sure get better with time."
a2p1U000000Rsn1QAC,0011U00000rijKxQAI,My recent appointment was with Dr. Thompson and she is a great Dr. She took the time to listen and truly understand my needs better than a male Dr. could. I know that she was only there temporarily but she would make a great addition to XYZ.
a2p1U000000Rp0PQAS,0011U00000rikEOQAY,was easy to schedule
a2p1U000000RsS3QAK,0011U00000rjCt2QAE,Super easy to get an appointment time

a2p4w000002O12HAAS,0014w00002pPZmFAAW,"While I had a good experience, I am still a little leary, on an administration level experience of customer service."
a2p4w000002O0RfAAK,0011U00000riv23QAA,Slow and painful
a2p4w000002O03EAAS,0013g000006tijiAAA,"It is new to me, and lack on my medical status information compared to the previous XYZ site."
a2p4w000002O0MpAAK,0011U00000rjrmLQAQ,appointments with no hassle or waiting
a2p4w000002O0iMAAS,0011U00000riCSHQA2,It is not in my nature to recommend doctors or treatments
a2p4w000002O0Q3AAK,0014w000031g26pAAA,Unorganized have been trying to get a prescription called in since appointment been unsuccessful.
a2p4w000002O21UAAS,0011U00000rjFq9QAE,Not easy to get into I am still waiting for blood work reports after two weeks and needed a form turned in for my work with Akron public and still waiting

a2p4w000002O1A1AAK,0014w000031g0WkAAI,I have been there twice since it was taken over by XYZ and both times when they did not have my meds(which is fine) they were to be called in to the local pharmacy. I have went to the pharmacy 2 times to pick them up and they have never been called in. Just seems like the NP doesn't care.
a2p4w000002O16iAAC,0011U0000125IggQAE,"I completely trust my doctor.  However,  only City of Akron employees, city schools employees and students and their families can go to XYZ."
a2p4w000002O1UkAAK,0011U00000rjXz8QAE,Polite and will listen to patient concerns
a2p4w000002O1sSAAS,0011U00000rjvn7QAA,My doctor on Wednesday was very nice polite explained everything in detail which I really like. He  was patient with me he also had a very great bedside manner.
a2p4w000002O10LAAS,0014w000031qePiAAI,Doctor and NP spend enough time with the patient.
a2p4w000002NzGqAAK,0014w00002pQDP6AAO,I like how thorough they are and they don’t rush to get you out of there. It makes you feel that they really do care about your health.
a2p4w000002O0nMAAS,0014w00002pPaOkAAK,I was pleased with my Provider
a2p4w000002O1gCAAS,0014w00002pQDPSAA4,"Very thorough, friendly and I felt like I mattered"

a2p1U000000Roc1QAC,0011U00000ri4qcQAA,Nice convenient health care with much more to offer.
a2p1U000000RsW7QAK,0011U00000riggoQAA,"I love and am confident in my care with the Dr, however, I feel like the support staffing is very unorganized to the point I do not have confidence in proper procedure"
a2p1U000000RoqlQAC,0011U00000rhv6vQAA,"Convience, Pleasant, Quick"
a2p1U000000RoRRQA0,0011U00000rjqabQAA,"Onsite, clean facility."
a2p3g000000oeXLAAY,0011U00000rjEahQAE,Dimly lit and could be cleaner at last in-office visit. Reluctant to go into office post pandemic.
a2p1U000000RvLvQAK,0011U00000riWOKQA2,"High touch, easy to schedule, nice functionality with patient portal through eClinical Works"
a2p1U000000RskWQAS,0011U00000rjHHMQA2,"All in all I was satisfied with the experience. The doctor forgot (and so did I) to prescribe something we talked about during the visit though...and it took two days to get a referral to a gynecologist. I asked to be contacted by email instead I got a call. These are really minutias, I'm not saying that my experience was spoiled by these facts. Just a reason not to give the full ""10"" vote."
a2p3g000000KypuAAC,0011U00000rjJwwQAE,The promptness and availability of being seen or the ability to reach a doctor via phone during off hours.
a2p1U000000Rt3DQAS,0011U00000rhxPBQAY,Forced to participate.
a2p1U000000Rp8PQAS,0011U00000rhwyXQAQ,"Ease of setting up an appointment, staff are very friendly, prompt service"
a2p1U000000RurEQAS,0011U00000rjUmhQAE,CONVEYANT
a2p1U000000RpxJQAS,0011U00000rj4KzQAI,They don't push for un needed tests.
a2p3g000000KzqaAAC,0011U00000riPrKQAU,"The doctor was excellent when I spoke to her. Very professional, kind and attentive. The a communication of the office was lacking. The phone call never came at the right time and I called to learn there were computer problems. Rescheduled for one hour later and again, late, no phone call. I called and they said the doctor would not be calling but she would call the next day at 7:30. It is now 7:53 and still no phone call."
a2p1U000000RqQWQA0,0011U00000riSamQAE,The providers are awful.
a2p1U000000RoQbQAK,0011U00000ri5DyQAI,"Because of the benefits of receiving a thorough physical, blood work and recommendations with no cost to me."
a2p1U000000RpMiQAK,0011U00000ri84qQAA,Doctor was very engaging and seemed to care about me and my health
a2p1U000000RqVXQA0,0011U00000rjPx2QAE,My new doctor was good.  My original doctor was not a good match for me.
a2p1U000000RsRpQAK,0011U00000riyXiQAI,"I had an 8am apt at the 15th Street clinic. I arrived 20 minutes early because it was my first time. The office was closed. I came back 10 mins to 8am, still closed. There is no where to wait I had to walk a few blocks away to a cafÃ© to wait. They didn't open until 8:01. It's a doctors office, usually they have a waiting area or let the patients know not to be there 5 minutes before because there is no where to wait and it was raining!"
a2p1U000000RqDaQAK,0011U00000rjh1uQAA,The convenience and cost is great.
a2p3g000000KzpnAAC,0013g000004Gjq8AAC,"Fast , thorough and friendly service."

a2p1U000000RpktQAC,0011U00000riqkTQAQ,Seems helpful with many locations throughout metro area
a2p1U000000RpWMQA0,0011U00000rjhevQAA,"Impossible to communicate with correct office location let alone a specific doctor or nurse. Customer service email address in health portal goes unanswered. Messages left at other locations also go unanswered. Ultimately, unable to reach doctor."
a2p1U000000Rsa2QAC,0011U00000rhuhPQAQ,"I am a bit doctor-phobic, so I usually don't do a lot of recommending in that arena"
a2p1U000000RqW2QAK,0011U00000rjMBuQAM,Amazing customer svc and communication by Dr.
a2p1U000000RsR1QAK,0011U00000rip02QAA,Overall feeling of not being rushed.  The doctor asked pertinent questions of me and anwered all of my questions.
a2p1U000000RqB1QAK,0011U00000riNWkQAM,From my first visit they seem very friendly and open to make sure I get adequate care.  It did not feel like a traditional doctor's office.
a2p1U000000RqAFQA0,0011U00000riUXjQAM,"Each visit has presented its own problems.  First visit in August, blood draw had to be redrawn due to error in labeling or vial.  This visit and subsequent ones were billed wrong.  Four EOB's later the error was corrected after I phoned my H.R. person.  My current EOB for an OCTOBER 12! visit just arrived mid February.  It advised me the charge of $168 (yet to be received) would apply to my yearly deductible.  This EOB was for a Shingrex Zoster that ought to be covered under ""preventative care"".  Med mutual advised me XYZ billed as out-of-network and  out-of-state. Why would a recommend this clusterfuck to anyone? Why would I recommend that the bill of goods sold my district would cost them extra in time chasing down paper trails that I don't have access to except by numerous phone calls? Not to mention added out of pocket expenses because all my local services are Out of Network?  Who in their right mind would choose a provider that is out of network? Steaming in Akron but not over the nurses or doctors.  They are fine."
a2p1U000000RtDgQAK,0011U00000riXevQAE,It's convenient for those of us working downtown that may not have the time to schedule an appt. with their regular doctor or in my case my physician has moved out of town and is no longer convenient for a quick visit.
a2p1U000000RpoQQAS,0011U00000riJOMQA2,"It was a good experience, but I will only recommend if a friend/family member ask."
a2p3g000000oRlkAAE,0011U00000rjTCNQA2,Friendly  staff and the Doctor
a2p1U000000RscDQAS,0011U00000rk5piQAA,I have not seen Dr. izard
a2p3g000000KzD3AAK,0011U00000riXwZQAU,I like the staff and that there isn't a long wait to be seen
a2p1U000000RsYkQAK,0011U00000rjaNWQAY,"My experience with XYZ doctor, although pretty minimal, has been quite positive."
a2p1U000000RoZ2QAK,0011U00000riuhMQAQ,Excellent care and east to deal with
a2p1U000000RoGDQA0,0011U00000rjwzvQAA,Waiting time for appointment was minimal.  Both doctor and nurse did a very good job of explaining all procedures.  Staff was friendly.
a2p1U000000Rp0IQAS,0011U00000riZaKQAU,"I have only been to one appointment, so far."
a2p1U000000RsfLQAS,0011U00000rk2XpQAI,Doctor spent time with the patient.  Short time frame to set appointment
a2p1U000000RpsGQAS,0011U00000riZNTQA2,The staff are friendly and seem to genuinely care for their patients.
a2p1U000000RtK3QAK,0011U00000rk90bQAA,Dr Hernandez is a nice Dr...hes is very attentive and really listens to what you say. He seems very knowledgeable and offers advice I feel I can trust. Nice person in general too.
a2p1U000000RockQAC,0011U00000rj2QQQAY,Individual attention
a2p1U000000RoLOQA0,0011U00000rjYUtQAM,"If it comes up in conversation, I would mention a good experience."

a2p1U000000Rq4MQAS,0011U00000riaDPQAY,I like the convenience at work and the locations (especially the exam room!) are comfortable and clean. The people are also very nice.
a2p1U000000Rp7wQAC,0011U00000rjm6nQAA,"My recent visit was a complete waist of my time. Nothing was accomplished,  no insight and a follow up shot they called me for and set up the appointment was three days too soon (outside the appropriate time frame) and was not given."
a2p3g000000oRqzAAE,0011U00000rjXz8QAE,Very kind courteous and thorough
a2p1U000000RovVQAS,0011U00000riaUEQAY,Everybody's their very friendly and doctors work with you
a2p3g000000KzuWAAS,0011U00000rinfHQAQ,Convince and quick

a2p1U000000RuwhQAC,0011U00000rjsXDQAY,Fast and easy. Really great care provided
a2p1U000000RpNiQAK,0011U00000sgzZTQAY,"I had a more personalized, non-rushed visit with my doctor."
a2p1U000000RsoZQAS,0011U00000riCmzQAE,"Our prior doctor diagnosed a couple things incorrectly, and I didn't really trust his judgement.  We got a new doctor after his retirement, and she got us on track with 2 issues right away."
a2p1U000000RqL6QAK,0011U00000ri8cnQAA,There has been a history of not getting referrals
a2p1U000000RokoQAC,0011U00000rjAqCQAU,I have heard good things.  This was my initial appointment. So far so good.
a2p1U000000RpaQQAS,0011U00000sgzZQQAY,"I don't know enough about it yet, so I don't have a strong opinion either way."
a2p1U000000RsSTQA0,0011U00000rjzyMQAQ,Like being able to really talk to the Dr.
a2p1U000000RpsUQAS,0011U00000rhuBPQAY,Good doctors and service
a2p1U000000RtF2QAK,0011U00000rkCR0QAM,Dr. Song Was patient and thorough.
a2p1U000000Rt0MQAS,0011U00000rjF6LQAU,This appt didn't give me a strong enough impression of XYZ Health to answer that one way or the other.
a2p1U000000RoQKQA0,0011U00000rk9zmQAA,"Ease of making appointments, high level of engagement with patients."
a2p1U000000RpzoQAC,0011U00000rjFcLQAU,"I like the one-on-one, relaxed environment and attitude, where there is adequate time allotted for me to have my issues addressed."

a2p4w000002KK3LAAW,0011U00000rjJwcQAE,"I've been seeing Jan Hester for almost 3 years and with XYZ I've never had a problem with scheduling my appointments online. I scheduled this last appointment through XYZs portal and when I drove the hour and a half it takes me to get to Jan's office, they didn't have my appointment on their schedule, thanks to XYZs scheduling issues. Thankfully Jan was able to squeeze me in but neither of us were very happy about the scheduling problems."
a2p4w000002KKeHAAW,0011U00000rjkJiQAI,"I did not like how the the medical professional soaped her hands and then immediately started rinsing after coming into the office. She did not use a hand sanitizer and I know you need to scrub longer than one second literally in order to remove germs. Also, she used her laptop and then opened the door and then pushed it shut with her hand on the door and did not wash or sanitize her hands before doing an internal exam.

There is more I would like to say but I think that the comments will be identifiable and easily linked back to me."
a2p4w000002O3hvAAC,0014w00002pQC86AAG,My appointment took entirely too long and the staff was unprepared
a2p4w000002O1woAAC,0014w00002pQG8pAAG,Its only been one visit and its only for Union
a2p4w000002O0fhAAC,0011U0000125JhiQAE,I like the fact that I am seen quickly. I hate having an appointment and then getting there on time and waiting another hour.
a2p4w000002O2oqAAC,0011U00000rjsCuQAI,I’m unlikely to provide an unsolicited referral to a colleague and I’m not likely to recommend XYZ to a friend that’s not a state of Colorado employee. So I put a 7 because I would if the right person asked.
a2p4w000002O1u4AAC,0014w00002pQLVMAA4,Only Union members and their families can use these services
a2p4w000002O2FRAA0,0011U00000rjXz8QAE,friendly and effective

a2p4w000002KKRXAA4,0011U00000riml0QAA,"I greatly appreciated meeting with Kenyatta. As this was our initial meeting, my experience was limited to a first phone call, I don't have a wealth of experience to rate."
a2p4w000002O3NlAAK,0011U00000ri173QAA,Friendly atmosphere and staff.
a2p4w000002KK3pAAG,0011U00000rjXZaQAM,"This was my first appt. with the provider. While I felt it went very well, it's too soon to make a strong recommendation one way or another."
a2p4w000002KK3kAAG,0011U00000riTw8QAE,I love Dr. Gray and got an appointment right away. Unfortunately the appointment was virtual and the app did not work correctly
a2p4w000002O1WRAA0,0014w000031pZBqAAM,It's been incredibly difficult to get a hold of someone at this facility.
a2p4w000002O17bAAC,0014w000031qjQLAAY,I enjoy having a place to go that can help me and also works well with my insurance. I think that others that have that opportunity should also utilize this service.

a2p1U000000RuuzQAC,0011U00000rjFc9QAE,It is easy to see my doctor and convenient too.

And less than a half a day later I have pink eye and a very sore throat that keeps me from sleeping she now won't get back to me for several hours.  This is very frustrating.  I am 58 years of age and know my bodies symptoms very well.  She made me feel like I was a crybaby for trying to be proactive about my health  instead of reactive
a2p1U000000RpSjQAK,0011U00000ribCcQAI,Great for routine appointments or minor issues; but not sure XYZ has the capacity to deal with more serious medical scenarios
a2p1U000000RsUYQA0,0011U00000riHbzQAE,They were friendly and I did not have to wait long.
a2p4w000002O46qAAC,0013g0000092E0FAAU,Good but nothing special
a2p1U000000RsUjQAK,0011U00000rjhepQAA,I felt the appointment felt corporate and not personal. I felt like that the doctor didn't really listen to my concerns.
a2p3g000000KyleAAC,0011U00000rhwhPQAQ,The doctor is not very interested or involved.
a2p1U000000RtJRQA0,0011U00000rjvTDQAY,"The staff is like family to me. I have laughed, cried and dream with them all while they were working to get me better."
a2p1U000000RoQGQA0,0011U00000rhqLtQAI,convenience. friendliness. cost effective.
a2p1U000000RsYpQAK,0011U00000rirCFQAY,Convience
a2p1U000000RtHJQA0,0011U00000rjIciQAE,Can not get in touch with Doctor like we were told.
a2p1U000000RpVzQAK,0011U00000rk0WBQAY,Fast & courteous.
a2p1U000000RsRKQA0,0011U00000rixpmQAA,"I'm just getting started so will have to see how it works out.  Was a little disappointed at my first appointment - didn't get to address a lot of what is going on with me.  Dr. is great, but spent a lot of time talking about only one aspect of an issue/treatment.  I'm hopeful it will get better and we'll address all of my issues."
a2p1U000000RpKuQAK,0011U00000rjRonQAE,Like the doctor and the low cost of the appt.
a2p3g000000L0RqAAK,0011U00000rhrZNQAY,"Based upon my first virtual appointment,  I was impressed on how attentive the doctor was to my health."
a2p1U000000Rq2VQAS,0011U00000riu8dQAA,"XYZ has a lot of conveniences which I love.  Dr. Hemphill is easy to talk to and is very personable.  She is very attentive and never ignores.  Dr. Martin does not respond to many things that are said making me feel very uncomfortable. He ignores a lot of what I said during the visit.   I asked for cough medicine due to a terrible cough that I have that was keeping me awake most of the night.  He stated that the antibiotics would help with that and did not call for a cough medicine.  Unless it's an emergency, I do not wish to go back to him for care."
a2p1U000000RoIIQA0,0011U00000rk7znQAA,"Pleasant fast service.   So far am very pleased.  Waiting to see how much the insurance pays, since no co-pay."
a2p3g000000LAeFAAW,0011U00000rjqabQAA,Facility wasn't prepared with touch-free tools to take temperature.
a2p1U000000RszbQAC,0011U00000rjHANQA2,I was worked into the schedule with a priority need on the same day I asked-just at a much later time than I would have liked.
a2p1U000000RpmBQAS,0011U00000rj8TZQAY,"i felt like my most recent appointment was heavily centered on getting the flu vaccine, when that had nothing to do with why i was there. i didn't appreciate the lecture over why i should get it."
a2p1U000000RorGQAS,0011U00000rk13mQAA,I felt like the doctor listened to me and was concerned with my outcome.
a2p1U000000Rt7CQAS,0011U00000riCQQQA2,"This was once a convenience, but every day it seems as though it runs more and more like any other clinic"
a2p3g000000oeUeAAI,0011U000019xyRnQAI,"Idon,'t know alot about the XYZ clinic myself. So before I tell other people I need to experience more for myself first"
a2p1U000000RslaQAC,0011U00000rjX8pQAE,Took a long time to get a call back to get appointment
a2p1U000000RoPqQAK,0011U00000rii9KQAQ,My doctor is very personable and helpful.
a2p1U000000RsnAQAS,0011U00000ri3KaQAI,"Wait time was long, but comfortable. It was very convenient"
a2p1U000000Rq1AQAS,0011U00000riAHpQAM,The service I received was great
a2p4w000002O4LlAAK,0011U00000risBkQAI,Convenience
a2p1U000000Rp36QAC,0011U00000riUAXQA2,"Convenient, professional service and I am really impressed with Dr. Morgan."
a2p4w000002O41HAAS,0014w00002pQBZnAAO,Convenience.  And right here at my workplace.
a2p1U000000RpcbQAC,0011U00000rk74vQAA,"It's for the Company employees, and the friend are not employees."
a2p1U000000Rq4SQAS,0011U00000rjgM4QAI,Easy and less rushed
a2p1U000000RpAnQAK,0011U00000rjPfzQAE,Convenient because of location in my work building. Would only recommend to those I know work downtown.
a2p1U000000RojxQAC,0011U00000rk51zQAA,"Dr Gorman seemed concerned but didn't 't pressure me, friendly atmosphere."
a2p1U000000RqbXQAS,0011U00000rjBP7QAM,Mess up my medicine with CIGNA  home delivery.
a2p3g000000KzsMAAS,0011U00000rjSsMQAU,I appreciate the care and the time that the staff shows to me on every phone call and or appointment
a2p1U000000Rt03QAC,0011U00000rjbOhQAI,because its free and convenient
a2p3g000000L0RyAAK,0011U00000rhxYqQAI,Quick response time and easy appointment scheduling
a2p1U000000RpXyQAK,0011U00000rjNtEQAU,Most of my friends are not employed by a Pall. Sponsor
a2p4w000002NzgZAAS,0011U00000rimknQAA,I don't know anything about how you run a business.
a2p1U000000RtIMQA0,0011U00000sh1MHQAY,convenience
a2p4w000002O2mpAAC,0014w00002pPq6lAAC,My first appointment was cancelled by the facility with very limited re-scheduling options offered. When I finally got to the appointment the doctor was 20 minutes late on the video call and they didn’t get my information to start so that took up half the appointment. I would say the clinics seem incredibly unorganized and chaotic.
a2p1U000000RsmSQAS,0011U00000rhz7pQAA,On time service. Friendly staff. Well-equipped office. Excellent prompt follow up by the doctor.
a2p1U000000Rq0fQAC,0011U00000ri8zrQAA,Got in there very quickly and the doctor was very thorough
a2p1U000000Rt3kQAC,0011U00000ribAGQAY,The doctor is very demeaning to the patients and is not ever available.  She is always a a conference or on vacation or away from the office.
a2p1U000000Rp7DQAS,0011U00000riXb7QAE,Have only experienced one appointment.
a2p1U000000RvGlQAK,0011U00000rjw79QAA,Everyone from the receptionist to the doctor were very attentive to my needs.
a2p1U000000RtFQQA0,0011U00000rj7fhQAA,"I really liked the atmosphere, the wait time was ideal, and the staff was nice and friendly. So far so good, still waiting to see how future appointments go."
a2p4w000002O2vDAAS,0014w00002pQIKyAAO,The Dr dismissed my needs
a2p3g000000L2PAAA0,0011U00000rkBYaQAM,Easy to use
a2p4w000002O2r1AAC,0014w00002pPb44AAC,The care from the Providers was amazing...they took time and talked to me and explained things very well.  The initial phone call and dealing with the MA's in trying to get an appointment was very frustrating.  If it were just for the care I received it would be a 10.
a2p1U000000Rt1EQAS,0011U00000riWOEQA2,"I like the """"slow health"""" philosophy embraced by XYZ."
a2p4w000002O2iTAAS,0014w000031rnsLAAQ,Very helpful and thorough.
a2p1U000000RqUCQA0,0011U00000rjB4nQAE,"No lines, you are the center of attention for your appointed time.  However, I had some questions that were not quite answered, but I hope they may be in the future."
a2p4w000002O3JUAA0,0014w000031pWW9AAM,"Just started with them, so far so good"
a2p4w000002O3BzAAK,0014w00002pPUvRAAW,Fast easy very professional
a2p1U000000RprVQAS,0011U00000rjKUbQAM,don't recommend
a2p1U000000RqFMQA0,0011U00000rjXdcQAE,They usually can get me into the office and are very helpful.
a2p1U000000RpTyQAK,0011U00000rjsnJQAQ,they are thorough and take time.
a2p1U000000Rp9tQAC,0011U00000riYKIQA2,Went for a blood test with the nurse.  Nurse was there took me to a room.  Nurse said the Doctor needed to speak to me before my blood drawing.  Doctor came in never introduced herself.  This was the first time I had ever seen her.  I am a patient of the other doctor.  She informed me that I needed to decide whom my primary doctor is.  This was a rather rude way to ask me this without any prior notice of this.
a2p1U000000RtK7QAK,0011U00000ri8d4QAA,"Easy to get in, great staff."
a2p1U000000RoUkQAK,0011U00000riEfaQAE,"Well there use to not be any wait but now you usually have to wait to see the dr. Also if you don't call at 8am you cant seem to reach a person , you just have to leave a voice mail and they don't return the call till after 3 or 4 pm, then they have no appointments left. One time I had an allergic reaction 2 hours later left message and then by the time they called me back they had no times left to see me. they told me to call my allergist my allergist was already closed , no help there."
a2p1U000000RpR0QAK,0011U00000rjF5rQAE,It is very hard to schedule an appointment or get anything refilled
a2p1U000000Rp0tQAC,0011U00000riYJoQAM,Good experience at a good price.
a2p1U000000RqD0QAK,0011U00000rivKsQAI,good service
a2p1U000000RpY9QAK,0011U00000rk5plQAA,"No reason,convience is reason I go to XYZ"
a2p1U000000Rpv7QAC,0011U00000rjoMeQAI,"I like the concept and I really liked my Dr.  Had a lot of trust in her, now she is leaving and I find that very unsettling"
a2p1U000000Ro5xQAC,0011U00000riHbaQAE,I will recommend to all my coworkers as the location is in our office and the staff was very nice.
a2p1U000000RtD9QAK,0011U00000rj5YSQAY,convenience
a2p1U000000RqczQAC,0011U00000ri9XTQAY,Dr. Cook is good. Easy to schedule appt.
a2p1U000000RpgOQAS,0011U00000riyGgQAI,Knowledgeable are courteous staff
a2p1U000000RpbJQAS,0011U00000rjvluQAA,my issues are handled thoroughly. my doctor and assistant are very friendly.
a2p1U000000RtHqQAK,0011U00000rjuCYQAY,"Dr told me my son didn't have croup simply bc of his age, ignoring his symptoms and history of getting it each of the prior 4 years he has been alive"
a2p3g000000LAesAAG,0011U00000rk476QAA,Response was quick and employees were very friendly and knowlegable.
a2p1U000000RsdDQAS,0011U00000rjMiZQAU,"Being right at work is soo nice, The staff are very friendly  and if they can't help they will find someone that will."
a2p1U000000RscHQAS,0011U00000rk63VQAQ,see last comment
a2p1U000000RoIOQA0,0011U00000rjz6WQAQ,"The staff was pleasant but could use a little practice in social interaction. However the nurse practitioner, Katie was great and interacted with me appropriately. Don't make the computer the person interested in me, just ask the questions."
a2p1U000000RsseQAC,0011U00000ri3vOQAQ,"Love the convenience of an urgent care being on-site; however, the visits are becoming very long and I don't have time for it. Most of us need to get in and out not to mention-urgent care's typically don't REQUIRE appointments which are VERY hard to get. I was asked my race which I have NO idea what bearing this has on my visit! Appts need to be shorter and you should block some time for urgent visits. Ask the patient if they want a primary care before asking them for their ENTIRE history"
a2p1U000000Rp02QAC,0011U00000rjaiyQAA,Most already have a PCP and being downtown wld also be an inconvenience.
a2p1U000000Rt1pQAC,0011U00000ri85BQAQ,Quick turnaround between requesting appointment and being seen.
a2p1U000000Rt8nQAC,0011U00000rk38mQAA,"Friendly staff and doctor. Free or low fees, close to my home, quick to be seen"
a2p3g000000Kyq8AAC,0011U00000rjMqyQAE,"I've always liked Dr. McCay, and have also seen a NP that was really good.  The other staff are friendly and efficient, the facilities are nice, comfortable, communication online and text/email updates are very helpful.  Overall a much better experience than when I was seeing Norton Community Medical Associates.  It's also a convenient location at work.  The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is if someone doesn't work at Humana, I don't know what other locations exist."
a2p1U000000RpxIQAS,0011U00000rjeBlQAI,You can't get through on the phone. If we didn't have the doctors cell number we don't know if we would ever get through or get a call back
a2p1U000000RsmDQAS,0011U00000rjt7NQAQ,"This is my second visit and seeking a prognosis. After I am diagnosed I will be able to better answer this question. So far, I enjoy Dr. Glaser."
a2p3g000000KzLJAA0,0011U00000rjq9xQAA,This was my first meeting.
a2p1U000000Rt1hQAC,0011U00000rjEbMQAU,"I have used XYZ as a way to steer clear of high cost doctor visits, but both times I have been there, I have had to go elsewhere due to the doctor not really knowing what the problem was.  This last time I was told to go to the emergency room, and then had a followup a few days later with a whole different doctor, who basically figured out the problem just by me listing my symptoms to her.  So the visit to XYZ where I had hoped to avoid costly doc visits has now turned in to an unnecessary emergency room visit, which will, without a doubt, be very expensive, and cause a lot of financial hardship for us as this point in our lives.  I do not think I will use XYZ services again."
a2p1U000000l8BfQAI,0011U00000rjnt5QAA,Very friendly  Make you feel at ease
a2p4w000002O42ZAAS,0014w00002pPOA2AAO,Ease of getting an appointment.  Attention at care; don't feel rushed.
a2p1U000000RqbuQAC,0011U00000rjw2TQAQ,I would prefer to go to my usual doctor. The nurses don't seem as skilled as the ones at my normal doctors office.
a2p1U000000RtIkQAK,0011U00000ri5LeQAI,Very attentive and thorough staff!
a2p1U000000RtLJQA0,0011U00000ripXTQAY,Great doc. She took good care of me.
a2p1U000000RsZfQAK,0011U00000rk2CUQAY,Appointment was kept on time and completed early.
a2p1U000000RoIEQA0,0011U00000rj6qwQAA,Appointment was met on time. Doctor took all the time he/I needed. Was able to get same day appointment. An actual human answered the phone.
a2p1U000000RsURQA0,0011U00000riYwVQAU,"Timely service, professional staff"
a2p4w000002O4XDAA0,0014w00002pQ8DRAA0,"I’d recommend it to more friends if I had more friends in the Union. Also, it’s far from where I live (minimum 30 minute drive). But the staff is friendly and the service is good."
a2p3g000000oRXnAAM,0013g000006tgVKAAY,Diversity
a2p1U000000RoSwQAK,0011U00000rjELzQAM,Friendly staff.  Convenient location.
a2p1U000000RoYbQAK,0011U00000rihbDQAQ,"I've had just one meeting and although the doctor was great, I was surprised by the absence of patients."
a2p1U000000RqcXQAS,0011U00000rjBP7QAM,They need to be here when they say they are. many times in Federal Way we go down an d no Dr is there that day.
a2p1U000000RqHTQA0,0011U00000ri3vQQAQ,It was convenient and close
a2p3g000000KyquAAC,0011U00000ri6H4QAI,Since I am a new patient with XYZ Health and have only meet one of your employees so far.
a2p1U000000Ro5aQAC,0011U00000rjfWjQAI,The Nurse Practitioner took the time to get to know me and spent quite a while talking with me.
a2p1U000000RpxZQAS,0011U00000ricA3QAI,My Doc is leaving and I don't know what the new Doc will be like
a2p1U000000RvP4QAK,0011U00000rjJ9OQAU,Cannot get ahold of Paladena to schedule an appointment. People that work on the road or other employment are not able to log on to computers to make an appointment.
a2p1U000000RsU8QAK,0011U00000rjLm6QAE,Not sure about this yet
a2p1U000000Rsp0QAC,0011U00000riNI4QAM,It was not easy to get a quick appointment when you are suddenly sick. Then you have to wait for meds and they tell you to try OTC stuff first.
a2p1U000000RqHDQA0,0011U00000rixpmQAA,Accessibility to drs.  Haven't had the need to see them much but always get in quickly.  Love the staff.
a2p1U000000RvOzQAK,0011U00000rk2CWQAY,Not a lot of options for docs
a2p1U000000RvPsQAK,0011U00000rjoKfQAI,Because this last appointment I made an appointment to check my blood pressure and explained i had already done my vitality and forgot the paperwork and I went in for the appointment and they started doing my vitality screening.
a2p1U000000RsZIQA0,0011U00000rhrG7QAI,"Making appointment was quick and easy. I was able to meet with Dr. Malfese in a leisurely way, with no pressure to hurry."
a2p1U000000Rp9nQAC,0011U00000ri632QAA,"This was my 1st visit.  Need to see if future visits are similar or the same.  Felt extremely rushed, didn't feel like I received a ""complete"" physical.  Noticed she had another patient waiting, so this may have been part of the issue.  A friend highly recommends Dr. Hester."
a2p1U000000RsUrQAK,0011U00000sgxUHQAY,The nursing service was quick with no wait times. The site was convenient. The doctor seemed abrupt and in general the visit with the doctor did not meet my expectations for personal interaction and discussion regarding my health and wellness.
a2p3g000000KzAVAA0,0011U000011EqpNQAS,"Easy to get an appt, saved a lot on copay and meds"
a2p1U000000RvXXQA0,0011U00000rjAQ8QAM,First appointment was great.  I really liked Dr. Wang but have only been there the one time.
a2p1U000000Rpg3QAC,0011U00000rjBwQQAU,Good overall experience from start to finish. Convenience/location is only reason keeping my score of 10.
a2p1U000000Rp1RQAS,0011U00000rjfWjQAI,Very easy to get an appointment and caring staff.
a2p1U000000RpbPQAS,0011U00000rhxFrQAI,Good service. Straight forward sign up and appointment scheduling. Nice facility
a2p1U000000l8H3QAI,0011U00000rja9yQAA,Very personable staff
a2p3g000000KylwAAC,0011U00000rjtSxQAI,"Extremely nice staff and doctors, hardly any wait times, and comprehensive care."
a2p3g000000oRZAAA2,0011U00000rhsCrQAI,Staff is very good
a2p1U000000RsxmQAC,0011U00000riq9CQAQ,Convenience.  Not 100% as I don't have a relationship with current doctor.  You seem to be having difficulty with staffing in general at our location.  Relationships are built over time.
a2p1U000000Rp82QAC,0011U00000rjcrYQAQ,Okay service. Not that impressed.
a2p1U000000RqgBQAS,0011U00000rikaWQAQ,Good service
a2p1U000000RtPiQAK,0011U00000rjdtpQAA,It has been convenient to book appointments there is no copay and my basic needs can be met here.
a2p1U000000RoN5QAK,0011U00000rjxQVQAY,Not satisfied with my care.
a2p1U000000RoTbQAK,0011U00000rk47JQAQ,We don't talk about providers.
a2p1U000000RojmQAC,0011U00000rhsZwQAI,"Friendly, quick service."
a2p1U000000RpAvQAK,0011U00000rjDksQAE,"Convenient, usually able to schedule appointments quickly and they don't rush through the appointment."
a2p1U000000RqU7QAK,0011U00000rjecyQAA,It's convenient
a2p1U000000RoxgQAC,0011U00000riAKRQA2,Convenience for APS employees
a2p3g000000KzqmAAC,0011U00000rjKpjQAE,Prompt service. Doctors take plenty of time to listen and work with the patient.
a2p3g000000oeY9AAI,0013g000006tjEyAAI,I  just started with XYZ    I have only one visit. But with my 1st appt. It was already a good experience. Spent quality time with me. Answered all questions and concerns.
a2p1U000000RqfeQAC,0011U00000riqSkQAI,Dr. Cook is great. He's very personable and answers all my questions to my satisfaction.
a2p4w000002JxpHAAS,0011U00000riytPQAQ,great staff
a2p4w000002NzgFAAS,0011U00000rjsB9QAI,Service is always very good.
a2p4w000002JsWtAAK,0011U00001An2dwQAB,Everyone has a doctor
a2p3g000000qOpqAAE,0013g000007ZX7RAAW,Went for severe knee pain was told to take ibuprofen 600 mg to help my pain..not helping at all..doctor ordered MRI was told it would take a couple weeks to get..somewhat dissapointed.will probably go back to primecare.
a2p3g000000qYY6AAM,0011U00000rj7eAQAQ,Doctor and assistants are pleasant to be around .  Can get appointment in a timely manner.  Quality healthcare.
a2p4w000002JwUmAAK,0011U00000riuGLQAY,I am still new to the clinic and learning how it works.
a2p4w000001prGWAAY,0013g000006tgf7AAA,Provider was very friendly and knowledgeable. Many provider options for telehealth. We don’t have a XYZ provider locally. I like the idea of having a provider available at all hours and low cost.
a2p4w000002JtIOAA0,0011U00000rhv6tQAA,they did NOT see me. I think they mostly do not see people.
a2p4w000002K8fSAAS,0011U00000rjefSQAQ,"My provider took the time to get to know me, listen to my concerns, and connect me to care that will improve my physical and mental health. Thank you!"
a2p4w000002JzdNAAS,0011U00000riDMaQAM,I am a member of a local 5
a2p3g000000qUObAAM,0013g000007ZWnoAAG,Felt the attention and care were good
a2p4w000001piLmAAI,0011U00000rjvUhQAI,"I really don't reccomend Doctors, most people just choose their own."

a2p1U000000RseHQAS,0011U00000riewhQAA,I feel the program is great for people not really haveing the funds to go to the Dr. when they really need to Its different from a reg docter office as far as cost.

a2p3g000000pJxuAAE,0011U00000rhypPQAQ,One provider has been consistent since our employer began using XYZ but the second doctor has been a revolving door of providers who are terrible listeners and just want to push new prescriptions
a2p3g000000p49RAAQ,0013g000006thv7AAA,They were friendly and made me feel comfortable.
a2p3g000000owKzAAI,0011U00000rjvTDQAY,My physician Kim Spencer is personable and always make sure she consider my medications before prescribing anything and she goes the extra mile with checking price at the pharmacy

a2p1U000000RoNoQAK,0011U00000rjDkwQAE,I left feeling worse than when I came in. The doctor I saw was overbearing.

a2p1U000000RvGCQA0,0011U00000riPBWQA2,"In this last visit I learned once I had retired and moved to Medicare I could no longer be a client of XYZ Health. I am so sad to receive this information. Why would I recommend XYZ to my friends when most of us are reaching that """" magic """" age of 65!?"
a2p1U000000RpcOQAS,0011U00000rizuUQAQ,it is a good practice

a2p1U000000RqKtQAK,0011U00000riYtfQAE,"I like the no wait appointment and calm atmosphere, individual service received.  I don't like receiving a lot of prescriptions although they may be good for me and it is my fault for the condition I am in.  It is hard for most nurses to get blood It is a 45 minute drive both ways to get there from my residence."
a2p1U000000RvZdQAK,0011U00000rjG7uQAE,I didnt really feel welcomed at all. No one introduced themselves to me or had good bed side manor.

a2p1U000000RtKUQA0,0011U00000ri9z7QAA,The lack of a consistent doctor has been very frustrating. Some of the doctors have been great and others less-so.
a2p1U000000RsROQA0,0011U00000riyXfQAI,"I really liked my experience with my XYZ visit and what XYZ can do.  That being said, that model of patient care is not for everyone.  I would only recommend it for those looking for the care model XYZ provides."
a2p3g000000L1POAA0,0011U00000rjTgQQAU,I've been satisfied with the service.
a2p1U000000RqLXQA0,0011U00000rhzvlQAA,"It is very convenient, but not too organized and reliable"

a2p3g000000LAedAAG,0011U00000riqiYQAQ,I have received high quality services from XYZ and I like the model where there is more personalized attention during visits. The turnover of doctors has been a bit of a concern.

a2p1U000000Rsw3QAC,0011U00000riQArQAM,"It's not a bad system, but I would appreciate the primary doctors office being closer to my home."

a2p3g000000KzEWAA0,0011U00000rhulIQAQ,I don't often just recommend doctors to people.  If they ask I would definitely suggest XYZ health.  It has been wonderful and easy.
a2p1U000000RpokQAC,0011U00000rhsixQAA,"Holistic approach, attentive staff, and knowledgeable doctor."
a2p1U000000RsSAQA0,0011U00000rjFppQAE,Communication seemed to be lacking between the doctor and receptionist.  It took over a week to get my medication called into my pharmacy.  The medication was only called in because I had to call back and ask for it.  Then I had to provide my pharmacy information again.   Incredibly frustrating
a2p1U000000RsysQAC,0011U00000rjMiZQAU,Even though Dr. Ritter is here a lot it is sometimes difficult to get an appointment sooner than later.
a2p1U000000RvZKQA0,0011U00000riu8NQAQ,"When I arrived, no one was at the desk.  Although I was notified to avoid scents, there was a strong smell of food.  I was asked about my medications and the staff asking seemed unfamiliar with them.  I asked if I could write down the names, and was told that they would do the writing.  I later asked if I could see what they had written, and was not allowed.  That made me decidedly uncomfortable.  The phlebotomist who took my blood put the needle into an awkward vein and had to try again in the other arm.  I have difficult veins, so this didn't surprise me but it didn't help."
a2p3g000000oRqQAAU,0011U00000rj04UQAQ,"ease of appointments, nice doctor"
a2p1U000000RqBeQAK,0011U00000riK5FQAU,2 items I thought that i was to have a annual checkup I showed up of the event and all that was done was to take blood .  Next item was I called to see if I could talk to the doctor about needing asthma meds for I was to be out of town for some time In my opinion the staff dropped the ball and did next to nothing not listening to what I had to say    VERY BAD
a2p3g000000KzJtAAK,0011U00000rhxc4QAA,The XYZ health in boulder didn't do a thing. My throat was swollen and they didn't do any strep test nor gave me any medication for symptoms.
a2p1U000000RqHFQA0,0011U00000rjKUbQAM,Simple access to care.
a2p1U000000RtMtQAK,0011U00000rkCrUQAU,"The wait time was low, and the nurses were fantastic. Dr. Cook is unlike any doctor I've ever had. He's funny, and personable. Which was such a nice change from my usual doctor experiences."
a2p3g000000KzGrAAK,0011U00000rjM32QAE,Convenience and easy access to Doctors and service.

a2p1U000000RsefQAC,0011U00000rjIhdQAE,"Interesting concept. Not entirely sure I like going through a medical home for everything.  Some things (mammogram, dermatology) require specialists and I'd rather go direct."
a2p1U000000RqYVQA0,0011U00000rjoKfQAI,The doctor should have asked if needed cough syrup and she did not and wanted me to call back 5 days later to see if I was still sick.
a2p1U000000Rt6bQAC,0011U00000rikoLQAQ,The dr is a really nice guy
a2p1U000000Rq4uQAC,0011U00000riMCPQA2,Fast knowledgeable and personal care.

a2p1U000000RpGWQA0,0011U00000riExxQAE,"I was supposed to get my blood drawn and for some reason after trying multiple different arms, hands and times XYZ was unable to draw blood. I came in the next morning to get blood drawn again and again XYZ tried multiple different routes without any luck and finally after trying for almost 40 mins, XYZ says that I now have to go get my blood drawn at labs. There should be a specialized person at XYZ who knows how to draw blood without making the patient deal with all of the difficulty to get blood drawn."
a2p1U000000RoQtQAK,0011U00000rjeBmQAI,"I went to have my injured knee looked at.....they sent me to x ray the same afternoon , that was great, thursady they said x ray showed no brakes but a possible issue with knee cap, try mri,  has been two weeks and today the 17th the doctor said he will try to get mri like he said last week but may take another week or two , could send to knee specialist but that would take longer,  meanwhile I am getting around on an injured knee that really hasn't been thoroughly checked ,  not very happy"
a2p4w000001ptyfAAA,0011U00000rinfHQAQ,Doctors are friendly and patient.
a2p3g000000q9zjAAA,0011U000019xyYJQAY,"When I called for an appointment I was told there no available times. Then I was asked if I'd like a virtual appt. I am not real comfortable with talking to a doctor online, but the woman on the call was very supportive and helpful. And during my appointment the doctor listened and really seemed to care."

a2p3g000000qepHAAQ,0011U00000riXChQAM,I love Dr Frantz. She takes her time and has really gotten to know me. I never feel rushed like she’s trying to get in as many appointments as possible.
a2p1U000000RsSSQA0,0011U00000riuNYQAY,"The Lakewood clinic got me in for an exam the same week I called; the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating; and Dr. D. was very patient and thorough, and provided very helpful advice."
a2p1U000000RqVEQA0,0011U00000rkD1HQAU,"I was the only patient in the office and when I saw the doctor - it was like I had interrupted her day? She just seemed to be there doing her job and since I was a new patient, I would of thought she would of been more friendly.... the nurse that day was very nice."
a2p1U000000RocKQAS,0011U00000ri8cnQAA,"I really like the Puyallup location dr, but not so much at the federal way office."
a2p3g000000ptSJAAY,0011U00000rjlO6QAI,"Very focused attention on my needs, small office"
a2p3g000000q3NjAAI,0011U00000riICZQA2,"Normally my visit was good, this visit was not. Saw a nurse practitioner instead of doctor, felt like i didn't get same attention. Then was to have blood work done but the lady was unable to draw blood. Poked both arms and fished around to get nothing. Ended up sending me down the street to Labcorp to have done and costed me $50 plus dollers.It was a whole new crew, never saw any of these people before. Hope you get back to old staff."
a2p3g000000qItBAAU,0013g000006thLjAAI,My doctor took time to ask questions and completed a very extensive history
a2p1U000000Rp5iQAC,0011U00000rk83dQAA,The staff was very friendly and acted interested in me as a person.  The doctor was friendly and very approachable and non-judgemental.

a2p3g000000Kyu0AAC,0011U000014s4spQAA,Some disorganization at this new site. First appointment discovered no lab services available so had to return another day. Now labs have been in portal a week but no call regarding abnormal results that need attention.
a2p1U000000RsWtQAK,0011U00000riV8dQAE,"Good, convenient service."
a2p1U000000RoSXQA0,0011U00000ri9eZQAQ,Typically I have never had any issues since I started going here; however the last time I went on Thursday 4/25; I was very disappointed. I was really hoping to get a referral to an orthopedic MD for a bad shoulder injury and was not given one. And probably secondly and most importantly the MD never called in the medication to my pharmacy that he said he was going to prescribe for me.... I was in really really bad pain and had to go an entire 36 hours without the medication. The next day when I tried to call and message to inform them of this; I needed to call back 4-5 times that day alone just to try and get my medication called into the pharmacy. At this point I was extremely upset that I had to go a full 36 hours  before my prescription was called in and then another 12 hours before the medication could be filled by my pharmacy. Altogether I went 48 hours without any medication and this bothered me ALOT.

This is my primary doctor, and though it has been very convenient and completely comfortable it seems I will be starting new again, it is time for me to get a regular doctor again, one that gets to know me as a person, instead of the next patient."

a2p4w000002O2BKAA0,0011U00000ri5sBQAQ,Always rude customer service from person working at front desk. Never welcoming .  It’s as if we walk in and disturbed them from their duties.  They then boss you around on what to do.  “Take a seat” “come over here for weigh in” “fill this out” “put your purse there” “come with me” ......  my blood pressure is high when I go here I hate the treatment.
a2p4w000002O0GrAAK,0014w00002pPayvAAC,I was not pleased with how long the appointment was.  My appointment took an hour and 15 minutes.  I waited for quite a bit of time in the room before seen and had to wait after to get my blood drawn.  I filled out the questionnaires online however had to repeat the paperwork in the office on paper and had other questionnaires to complete as well.  I recommend having this all done online before so time isn't wasted having to complete it again in the office.

a2p1U000000RpftQAC,0011U00000ringxQAA,There are no female doctors available and Dr. John tends to make appointments last too long due to talking about non-medical related topics. I prefer to get in and out. I also don't need financial advice from a physician.

However I switched to Dr. Everett who is significantly further away from me but she has been wonderful to see, she really took the time to talk with me and listen to my thoughts."
a2p3g000000KyshAAC,0011U000019xyfeQAA,"Doctor and I talked a little about my health history and what medications I am taking and decided that she wouldn't continue prescribing several of the medications I've been on long term. She implied that my current MD is just one of those doctors that ""will prescribe to you whatever you want,"" which is not the case at all."

I never heard back.  I called a week later and left a message, had no response.  I mentioned that I bicycled for exercise and the doctor told me humans weren't meant to ride a bike.  I thought that was odd and that a doctor would promote exercise.  It was a very discouraging visit and frustrating to not hear back. it seemed very unorganized also.  I plan to find somewhere else to go for my care."

a2p1U000000Rt7BQAS,0011U00000rjacIQAQ,"have only used once so far to completely judge,  but was pleased with my initial visit with my provider"
a2p4w000002O3NCAA0,0014w00002pQJGcAAO,Good standard of care. The only issue I have had is that the new app seems to have had some problems and my messages now go unanswered.
a2p1U000000Rpt3QAC,0011U00000rj5YSQAY,"I like the convenience, although in this situation I had to travel pretty far to find an open appointment. Also unhappy to have so much turnover of the physicians in the 15th street location"
a2p1U000000RpgPQAS,0011U00000rjvneQAA,"Misdiagnosed. The doctor said I had a viral throat infection and gave me no medicines. but in two days it was so bad that I couldn't even talk. I did call for a follow up and they said I rather go to ER. instead, I went to another doctor and they said it was Strep throat. and immediately put me on antibiotics."
a2p3g000000Kzw1AAC,0011U00000rk0F6QAI,We've been very pleased with the service.
a2p1U000000RpsXQAS,0011U00000rj0LKQAY,Too early to tell yet. First visit was pleasant and welcoming with both the doctor and the assistant. My impression is I will be happy I chose to switch to XYZ
a2p3g000000oeZDAAY,0011U000019xyRZQAY,It was very quick and they had patient safety in mind as you entered the office.
a2p1U000000RtU4QAK,0011U00000rjMr0QAE,not very impressed with the doctor
a2p1U000000RpSgQAK,0011U00000ri71BQAQ,over all good experience
a2p3g000000KylnAAC,0011U00000riNUvQAM,great personal care.
a2p1U000000RqErQAK,0011U00000rj8ooQAA,Convenient location and very kind staffs
a2p1U000000RsbgQAC,0011U00000rjcU2QAI,The practice is new and adjusting.
a2p1U000000RpEmQAK,0011U00000rjzwlQAA,Inefficient use of time.
a2p1U000000RsVjQAK,0011U00000rjopjQAA,"Feel I get good care, personalized attention. So far no long waits."
a2p4w000002O3ewAAC,0011U00000sgyVfQAI,"Convenient, comprehensive healthcare that is provided by caring professionals for an affordable price."
a2p1U000000RtQaQAK,0011U00000rjpFkQAI,"Friendly staff , ease of scheduling appointment, doctor doesn't rush"
a2p1U000000RoilQAC,0011U00000rjEakQAE,I haven't always felt like the physicians know what they're doing. One literally was GOOGLING my symptoms while I was talking and reading to me what gastroenteritis was.
a2p1U000000RsVxQAK,0011U00000rjiXKQAY,It was hard to get in for a sick visit. Also took 5 business days to get results for a lab. Poor communication. Actual visit was very helpful.
a2p1U000000RoxWQAS,0011U00000rjRAnQAM,I have only had one visit with XYZ.  So far it seems good.
a2p1U000000RtGlQAK,0011U00000rjfkvQAA,Dr did not seen very thorough and very hands off
a2p1U000000RqCIQA0,0011U00000ripneQAA,"Caring staff, usually  don't have to wait (on time appointments)."
a2p1U000000RsXQQA0,0011U00000rjTyhQAE,XYZ responded quickly when I called to set up an appointment and have the doctor see me expeditiously.
a2p1U000000Rq7TQAS,0011U00000rjJyxQAE,One stop shop Good amount of time spent with patient
a2p1U000000RsYWQA0,0011U00000riHvXQAU,"After reeiving an appointment confirmation a week before the appointment and a reminder the day before, when I arrived I was not on the schedule. Then the blood reader was not functioning so I was told I would need to fast again and come back another day. A Do-in-a-Box could have done a better job."
a2p1U000000Rt4SQAS,0011U00000sgyb1QAA,Very friendly staff and doctors.
a2p1U000000Rsa3QAC,0011U00000rk45NQAQ,"Like the place, but I don't know if just anyone can go to XYZ. I thought it was exclusive to county employees."
a2p1U000000RsvXQAS,0011U00000rikaOQAQ,I have only had one visit and that is not enough time to become familiar.
a2p1U000000RsVSQA0,0011U00000rjyaKQAQ,It is good for the one on one personal attention. The Doctors talk to you like a person and not over your head. Looking to provide the lowest price for a procedure may not be the best quality.
a2p1U000000RqaDQAS,0011U00000rhwPcQAI,I felt that Dr. Muse was very insightful and that I received quality care during my time there.
a2p1U000000RpVkQAK,0011U00000rjnPUQAY,"I sat and listened to the doctor tell me about himself for an hour.  Not much was asked about my medical background.  I need a doctor who listens, not talks about himself."
a2p1U000000RtFSQA0,0011U00000riMCFQA2,I would like for you to phone me to discuss. My service over a year has been quite poor. I am still ill and receiving insufficient medical care.
a2p1U000000RszjQAC,0011U00000rhsYfQAI,I do not feel that there is the same level of motivation that I would receive from my normal Doctor.   It seems pretty obvious that saving money is the goal.
a2p3g000000KyrpAAC,0011U00000rjoqFQAQ,"I've had great experiences with my PCP, Ashley Giles.  She is attentive, provides excellent follow-up, and really cares about my well-being.  However, I had a recent urgent care appointment with Rob that was less than satisfactory.  I came into the office with multiple internal hordeola in my left eye, and instead of advising me that he was not qualified to diagnose and treat/refer me to an ophthalmologist, he was dismissive and did not listen to my concerns.  He told me that I had no hordeloas and that it looked like I ""might have pink eye"".   This was incorrect.  After following up with my ophthalmologist's office, I have learned that I have a severe staph infection in my eye and had about 12 blocked meibomian glands which were developing into abcesses.  After over a month,  I am still being treated for this condition."
a2p1U000000RtI6QAK,0011U00000sgyb7QAA,Friendly and timely service.
a2p1U000000RpmpQAC,0011U00000rj6d6QAA,There was an emergency that took place right before I arrived. The staff seemed to be in a panic. As a health care professional it is important that you control a situation because if you are in a panic and running around like a chicken with your head cut off then you can not keep the patients calm and focused in order to assist them. I understand unknowns can take place but you still have to keep things flowing and the staff did not do a good job of that. There may need to be some training on who a point person would be in case of emergency and who would continue running the rest of the office and attending to the rest of the patients instead of the entire office concentrated on one person. I left the office and came back an hour and a half later and most of the office was still tending to the emergency so no one could service the people waiting at the front desk.
a2p1U000000RpQQQA0,0011U00000rjYzTQAU,Convenience and very good service.
a2p1U000000RpnhQAC,0011U00000rihuzQAA,The care I receive from my doctor is awesome. She makes me feel comfortable and glad for my periodic check-ups.
a2p1U000000l8BeQAI,0011U00000rjw51QAA,Convenient.  Sincerely interested in your well being. Cost aware.  Support staff follow up can be  from good to better.
a2p1U000000RpRZQA0,0011U00000ri3vOQAQ,"While the onsite clinic is convenient, it is not very efficient or available"
a2p1U000000Ro5hQAC,0011U00000rjy27QAA,Because the staff is very caring and is there to help with your health needs
a2p1U000000RurPQAS,0011U00000rk2ZwQAI,"Not sure yet, this was my first visit. Love our Dr. Eric Miller. But this is a totally new concept. Have to have more experiences"
a2p1U000000RpNOQA0,0011U00000rj4fPQAQ,"I think it works great, but it isn't something I talk about much"
a2p1U000000Rt6SQAS,0011U00000ribCcQAI,Convenience
a2p1U000000RpEdQAK,0011U00000riYFcQAM,Cost effective model with patient oriented care that works for the whole family.
a2p1U000000RtDNQA0,0011U00000rjtT3QAI,Level of  Attention I was shown.
a2p1U000000RtPRQA0,0011U00000rjlzqQAA,They were friendly and explained what was going on with me in terms I could easily understand.
a2p4w000002O3fkAAC,0013g000006thv7AAA,"Friendly, Knowledgeable,  Informative"
a2p1U000000RtTWQA0,0011U00000riDhsQAE,Very satisfied with care given
a2p3g000000KzDlAAK,0011U000014qI2bQAE,I just moved here I don't know a lot of people
a2p1U000000Rt9OQAS,0011U00000riwDzQAI,Friendly and close to work
a2p4w000002KKpjAAG,0011U00000rk903QAA,"Ease of scheduling, high quality care"
a2p4w000002NyhgAAC,0014w00002pQGc0AAG,Very convenient
a2p3g000000LAdRAAW,0011U00000ribAGQAY,"Convenient access to doctor, same day appointment"
a2p1U000000Rp5fQAC,0011U00000rikqSQAQ,It has worked fine for me.
a2p4w000002O3IvAAK,0014w000031qjQEAAY,The receptionist is incredibly hard to understand and gets confused about times very easy
a2p1U000000RoDGQA0,0011U00000riExiQAE,i dont just talk about heath care with people
a2p1U000000RpdHQAS,0011U00000riziqQAA,Doctor time spent with patient
a2p1U000000RpSpQAK,0011U00000rjerpQAA,Friendly caring service
a2p4w000002O34tAAC,0014w000031fxjpAAA,Easy access with quality care
a2p4w000002O3sFAAS,0011U00000riCn3QAE,Dr. Snow is professional and down to earth. I felt comfortable discussing my health with her. She gave valuable information and efficient feedback.
a2p1U000000RpQ6QAK,0011U00000riUavQAE,My doctor and staff are great. I really like the treatments I get there.
a2p1U000000RqC6QAK,0011U00000rk2qDQAQ,No waiting in the waiting room. Doctor takes time not rushed.
a2p4w000002O38bAAC,0013g0000091uY0AAI,"In clinic staff were very nice and helpful, but the process to make an appointment was frustrating."
a2p4w000002O35DAAS,0014w00002pQBnAAAW,"I was treated with respect I did not wait long, and all my questions were answered."
a2p4w000002O3p1AAC,0014w000031qlzoAAA,This facility is for aisin employees  only I don't have  friends there
a2p1U000000RsrgQAC,0011U00000rjXoaQAE,"Effecient service, personable staff."
a2p1U000000RtLpQAK,0011U00000rk2EtQAI,"No waiting, good experience. Drs spend plenty of time if you need it."
a2p1U000000RqaGQAS,0011U00000ri1FyQAI,"It was easy to make an appointment, and I felt like I got good information from my physician. Unfortunately, the clinic is not conveniently located for most people I know."
a2p3g000000KzIAAA0,0011U00000rk901QAA,Dr. Masterson and Kathleen provide excellent care and are so sweet and so kind.
a2p1U000000Rq3HQAS,0011U00000rhtndQAA,Friendly staff and prompt service
a2p1U000000RotTQAS,0011U00000rjj4AQAQ,better service
a2p1U000000RtLjQAK,0011U00000rjiFMQAY,"Everyone is professional, knowledgeable, and kind"
a2p1U000000RoCQQA0,0011U00000rj4xAQAQ,My doctor just converted over to you. Although I like the fact my monthly fee is being paid I miss the way my doctor was doing things. I moved from Banner health due to the computer entries (NUMEROUS) that had to be done when I was checked in and when the doctor saw me. I feel this takes away from the actual office visit. You should look into the system my doctor was using instead of converting her over to your most tedious and time consuming method.
a2p1U000000RqAnQAK,0011U00000sgxUEQAY,"Caring service, listen intently"
a2p1U000000RoMgQAK,0011U00000rjNAkQAM,Good Doctor services
a2p1U000000Rt56QAC,0011U00000rj9hHQAQ,"Was very happy with the doctor, just don't know anybody around me looking for a new doctor"
a2p1U000000RpSMQA0,0011U00000ri8kNQAQ,"I am wondering if when I have labs done, I am getting full lab work on blood and urine, or just the minimum tests run, that would make me hesitant about recommending XYZ over another option."
a2p1U000000RqJEQA0,0011U00000rjrbtQAA,It was very convenient and by pre-scheduling there is a short wait time.
a2p1U000000Ro8lQAC,0011U00000rjYnoQAE,They was able to get me appointment when I needed to see a doctor
a2p1U000000RuqnQAC,0011U00000rjJwrQAE,Service could be better
a2p3g000000KzGEAA0,0011U000019xylMQAQ,Easy
a2p1U000000RofJQAS,0011U00000rjsUVQAY,I loved my new doctor. She took the time to listen to my needs and concerns.
a2p1U000000RpczQAC,0011U00000rjkbKQAQ,"It's been pleasant working with the office. Appreciate the access, timeliness and availability of the staff."
a2p1U000000RtRgQAK,0011U00000rjt7NQAQ,It's convenient for me and easy access to the doctors.
a2p1U000000Rpm7QAC,0011U00000riq8nQAA,Only associates can access the office
a2p1U000000RtP5QAK,0011U00000riEfaQAE,"well when is was still Concentra , service was quicker and better. I use to be able to get in and out. Now I'm lucky if I can even get an appointment . If I'm sick the soonest appointment is 5 days out. well I cant wait 5 days when I'm sick so I have to go to immediate care or another retail health care clinic ."
a2p1U000000Rt7qQAC,0011U00000ri0ieQAA,since it was a minor sore throat and sniffles it was more convenient than making an appt to go to my family dr.
a2p1U000000RpzaQAC,0011U00000riK5fQAE,It was my first time meeting Dr. Carter and I had a very good experience.  She was attentive to my needs. She is very knowledgeable and worked through my concerns and gave me useful suggestions.
a2p4w000002O3eSAAS,0014w000031qRR8AAM,My first visit to an XYZ clinic. Still in a 'wait and see' mode overall
a2p1U000000RpJ0QAK,0011U00000ri8LHQAY,"I found it odd that at my initial appt, it seemed that the doctor tried to discourage my using her as a Primary care physician stating that for annual exams it would probably be ok but for more acute issues she would have limited availability due to her schedule at off-site locations. She didn't seem to be engaged during our discussion and actually yawned several times which did not bode well from my perspective. During my lab appointment the tech had an issue drawing blood from the initial poke and ended up having to get the rest from a second draw on my hand which I found unusual. After waiting over 3 weeks to hear from the doc re the lab results and/or to be able to see the results online via your website, I em'd XYZ and received a response saying they would have someone from the office contact me. I finally received a call and was told that the doctor hadn't reviewed the results and that was why I hadn't heard and why the results weren't online but now she had and needed me to schedule an appt to come in and review the results. This is not the experience I expected based on the info provided by both Eaton and XYZ and I  it be using XYZ in the future."
a2p3g000000Kyp2AAC,0011U00000riRewQAE,Ease of service and cost
a2p1U000000RoKJQA0,0011U00000ri9K4QAI,"Convenience, trust and flexibility"
a2p1U000000Rp8zQAC,0011U00000riLUyQAM,I am able to schedule appts fast and usually on the same day that I call to be seen on. It's very personalized.
a2p1U000000RpTDQA0,0011U00000rikWiQAI,"Still forming opinion, only had one visit"
a2p1U000000Rsc3QAC,0011U00000riDQCQA2,Everyone around me is already involved.
a2p1U000000RscPQAS,0011U00000ri0eLQAQ,Offered through work -- not something I can recommend to my friends.  Closed network.
a2p3g000000Kyr7AAC,0011U000011EqNDQA0,"They sent confirmation emails, there was minimal paperwork for admission, the evaluation was thorough, for each question the doctor asked he explained what he was listening for and why; he paused after explaining something giving me time to process what he was saying in case I had questions. Lab results came in the following day and the doctor gave the results, explaining what the results meant."
a2p1U000000Ro5DQAS,0011U00000ri2CQQAY,It was a great experience
a2p1U000000Rp5mQAC,0011U00000rhynUQAQ,your facility doesn't like presecribing antibiotics.
a2p1U000000RpBSQA0,0011U00000riFsLQAU,"Always have appt times, super nice folks, but docs don't seem particularly knowledgeable or experienced. They've gotten a few treatments wrong the first time for me."
a2p3g000000KzsLAAS,0011U00001AmxELQAZ,"I had a pleasant experience, but was only in for a minor prescription request. I did not have any serious health concerns or issues that needed to be addressed."
a2p3g000000oeVuAAI,0013g000007ZhbUAAS,"First visit, only blood draw.   Not much happened to report on."
a2p1U000000Rsk2QAC,0011U00000rj4xYQAQ,I love the concept of offering a more personal care service.  I really enjoy the flexibility of scheduling and contacting the doctor.  I only gave it a 6 though because I didn't LOVE the doctor.
a2p4w000002O3q4AAC,0011U00000rjDCzQAM,I loved when XYZ was small and in a better location.  This group has gotten so big that it is no longer as easy to get an appointment time that works well.
a2p1U000000Rt86QAC,0011U00000rj0xhQAA,"I was in the office for one symptom, however after the visit with the Nurse Practicioner we found solutions to mor than just what I came in for. The staff really made the visit worthwhile."
a2p1U000000RsVMQA0,0011U00000rhwPPQAY,My annual physical had to be rescheduled from a previous date due to an appointment mistake and then it was rushed through.
a2p4w000002O40iAAC,0014w000031s1hIAAQ,"My appointment was at 8 am I was the first pt of the day. It took 2 minutes to fill out paperwork so why the wait to get in exam room. I’m on my way to work,  I get paid by the hour. I’m in a hurry, to get to work."
a2p1U000000RornQAC,0011U00000rjIcpQAE,"No wait time, friendly and knowledgeable."
a2p3g000000oRWuAAM,0013g000006tftNAAQ,It is too early to form an opinion
a2p3g000000KyluAAC,0011U00000rja3LQAQ,I rated it a 5 because it depends on what their need is.  I have had very simple things to address that I thought they should be able to do and couldn't because they didn't have the appropriate/basic equipment available.
a2p1U000000RqXeQAK,0011U00000rhsdxQAA,"Convenient, great service, and easy to access."
a2p1U000000Rt1mQAC,0011U00000rjcs7QAA,Everybody was very friendly and lately that is missing in the health care industry
a2p4w000002O44fAAC,0011U00000rjt29QAA,Because the dr takes her time with you and tends to all your concerns and needs.
a2p3g000000oeXUAAY,0011U000019xyiOQAQ,"I was asked to come in for a Covid test due to my symptoms. When the doctor came out to my car, he asked if I was another person. I quickly corrected him and he said oh yes that is right. He asked my symptoms and then stated that he would do a strep test so he went back and got that. He did the strep and the Covid test and said I would hear back in a couple hours about the strep test and 24 hours later I have not heard anything."
a2p3g000000KymSAAS,0011U000011Ep4vQAC,"+ didn't feel rushed + concept is good beautiful facility, but a challenge to find - underwhelmed by physician"
a2p1U000000RokTQAS,0011U00000rj4FvQAI,"It is very difficult to get a Doctor Appointment: Computer screen says doctor appointment is on a date and confirmation:  then Receptionist call back  2 days later, and say doctor appointment date was not accepted.  Making it very difficult:  and Doctor appointment dates are set 2 months, or 1 months in the future, by then your symptoms could have alleviated, or have progress worsen; unless you seek on your own another Physician.  The scheduling in the computer is frustrating, when you think that you have made an successful doctor appointment, and it appears that way, on the computer; however, you get a call back a few days later, saying:  You have to reschedule, because your appointments dates wasn't accepted:  And a person is thinking that it did go through!"
a2p1U000000RsXxQAK,0011U00000sgywIQAQ,Fast service and Dr. Halley is great.
a2p1U000000RpM0QAK,0011U00000rhpV6QAI,"I think the clinic is nice, however, I am wondering about the doctor I saw"
a2p4w000002O3ToAAK,0011U00000rjbWvQAI,Great service
a2p1U000000RsZnQAK,0011U00000riDQ9QAM,"For a simple blood draw, my appointment was changed twice, then when I showed up,  the office was closed."
a2p1U000000RpomQAC,0011U00000riuh7QAA,I like the one on one with DR and no hurry through
a2p1U000000RoIJQA0,0011U00000rjCJKQA2,Initial reaction to the receptionist was a bit off-putting.
a2p1U000000RtPAQA0,0011U00000rjGFnQAM,The staff seemed uninformed and not very engaged.  I would prefer face to face vs Telemed.
a2p1U000000RpGaQAK,0011U00000riYFrQAM,Accessibility
a2p1U000000Ro9dQAC,0011U00000rk4kkQAA,The system is nice for those who only really need preventative care. The doctor was very personable.
a2p1U000000RpIaQAK,0011U00000rj7eAQAQ,"Convenience, unlimited visits with out charge if I am a CDOT United Health affiliate.  Have been pleased with the doctors and assistants."
a2p1U000000Row7QAC,0011U00000riTFHQA2,"Convenient to schedule, and the attention paid to me by the provider was better than expected."
a2p1U000000Ro5uQAC,0011U00000riSbWQAU,"Waiting too long, and not clear directions after the visit."
a2p1U000000Rp0DQAS,0011U00000rj5KDQAY,I fell as though the doctors listen
a2p1U000000RuwHQAS,0011U00000rkBClQAM,I felt she was engaged in what concerns I had and did a full wellness check on any of the concerns as well as making sure there were not other concerns that had not been discussd. She took her time and did not rush me as well as followed up by phone and provided me with the results of all my test. Great communication
a2p1U000000RoasQAC,0011U00000rjUDwQAM,"Convenient, personalized attention."
a2p3g000000oeVSAAY,0011U00000riZpNQAU,"Timeless, attentive and knowledgeable."

a2p1U000000Ro6JQAS,0011U00000rjQu1QAE,"I had great interactions with staff the day of my visit. I'd called several weeks before to schedule an appointment however, but was never logged in XYZ's system so I arrived and did not have an appointment registered. The staff were extremely accommodating though and made room for my visit."
a2p1U000000RptBQAS,0011U00000riFHKQA2,"Doesn't seem like we can get in same day anymore. Other than no co-pay, it's pretty much the same as seeing a physician outside now. I've heard a few say its lost its convenience."
a2p1U000000l8DXQAY,0011U00000ri8LTQAY,no
a2p1U000000RpwrQAC,0011U00000ri5sOQAQ,"I went in not feeling well, I had an earache, and a bad cough, I was told to just complete the basics. Humidifier, steam shower, etc. I ended up needing to return because I am way worse than I was before."

a2p3g000000KzKUAA0,0011U00000rk9IYQAY,Doctor was very unfriendly and judgmental! The nurse-secretary was very friendly and out going! The only reason I gave a 3 and not a 0
a2p1U000000Rp5qQAC,0011U00000rjpXZQAY,It was my understanding that the clinic was limited to a certain group of people. I was unaware anyone was welcome.
a2p1U000000RvO7QAK,0011U00000riR0qQAE,Nice people.
a2p1U000000RogbQAC,0011U00000rjQabQAE,convenient to work if they are a state employee it is kinda nice

a2p3g000000pi17AAA,0013g000009hIwyAAE,It was relatively easy. Kind of a soup-to-nuts shop. I liked it.

a2p3g000000pVBnAAM,0011U00000rjyfZQAQ,It is easy to make an appointment and the appointment is fully covered by my company. The turnover of providers is high so I marked this lower

a2p3g000000pgSBAAY,0011U00000riJ3VQAU,I was very disappointed in my recent physical with Dr David Smith.

a2p3g000000owNJAAY,0011U00000rhpd4QAA,I do not have enough experience with XYZ to make recommendations. The only interaction I have had was the initial consultation over the phone with the physician.
a2p3g000000pX8CAAU,0011U00000rj60lQAA,Love this place
a2p3g000000pnmwAAA,0011U00000rjwb4QAA,"It has been easy for me to use, but I'm not sure how it would work for other insurance plans."
a2p3g000000pKytAAE,0013g000007ZZ3xAAG,"The exam was mostly oral. No breast exam, just a question if there were any concerns with breast tissue. This has always been conducted at every physical I've ever had, Perhaps it was because I am scheduled for a mammogram, but this should be done. I also went in for a PAP and was told recommendations had changed and I only need them every 3-5 years. Again, this should be told to clients when they make the appointment. 

In addition, I was asked to disrobe and then spent 60 minutes answering questions sitting on the exam table, which is not very comfortable. There was nowhere for me to hang my clothes and then the only reason I disrobed was so the PA could hear my lungs (no pap, no breast exam). If we are going to have an hour talk, I should have had my clothes on, then the PA leave for me to change for the part of the exam that requires me to be naked."
a2p3g000000p5GnAAI,0011U000011EneYQAS,"Visit was good, similar to any other dr visit I’ve had"
a2p3g000000pU47AAE,0011U000019xyfaQAA,"It was very odd that only one person did the receptionist job, labs, and evaluation. She did fine, but it felt unsafely under-staffed.
The office presentation seemed old/dingy/not welcoming (in a way it seemed dirty, but I know it wasn't)"
a2p3g000000pdgAAAQ,0011U00000rjJK7QAM,I really like Dr. Matson and think she is providing excellent care. She is thinking of the big picture of my health. She does not just prescribe more medications to address issues.
a2p3g000000owMrAAI,0011U00000rjNsxQAE,"Not sure how I feel about current doctor options.  I loved Dr. Cook and was surprised to see him leave, and my recent visit with the PA was just ok, at best. I was a big fan of XYZ and Dr. Cook, hoping I can find a new provider who I like as well."
a2p3g000000owMoAAI,0011U000019xylDQAQ,Nobody answers the phone...the woman who takes your blood is also the receptionist.She didnt even measure my height; she simply asked me how tall I am

a2p4w000002JwVGAA0,0011U00000ritnwQAA,"Staff was friendly, but I was told 35 minutes after my appointment time that the doctor was running behind. Also, I advised the nurse beforehand that it is hard to draw blood on me and i ended up being stuck twice for blood."

The Dr. at the hospital stated to me, your appendix is fine, but you have a torn muscle from your illiac crest down into your groin.  I've been struggling now for 8 weeks, trying to get set up with physical therapy, and have not received a return call from the Dr's office yet."

a2p1U000000RtBIQA0,0011U00000rhyVXQAY,"The only benefit is that it is here at work.  I picked up my medication, at my usual drug store. 2 days later I left a message for the doctor because my cough was keeping me up all night.  I left the message on Friday afternoon and never received a call back or acknowledgement of my call.  This is unacceptable, I thought they are suppose to return your call."
a2p1U000000RtUKQA0,0011U00000rjEr6QAE,Difficult to get appointment in timely fashion.

I use your clinic as my primary care but have been thinking of changing simply because it is hard for me to be seen when I am sick."

a2p3g000000KzprAAC,0011U00000rjbv6QAA,"The doctors at my clinic always do the absolute least amount of care possible. Even when it is clear that testing might be warranted for diagnosis, they won't even do screening tests. They quickly, and NOT thoughtfully, come to a conclusion without giving the benefit of the doubt that a problem might not be just superficial."
a2p1U000000Rob7QAC,0011U00000rjGszQAE,Clean and professional people and environment.
a2p1U000000RpjbQAC,0011U00000riv1wQAA,"The services are limited to Humana employees, so unless a Humana employee is in need of the service, I would not be likely to recommend otherwise.  If a Humana employee asks, I would recommend the service, yes."
a2p1U000000RsgHQAS,0011U00000rirxyQAA,"The attention and care I received was much more detailed and unhurried than any other primary physician I have been to. Instead of feeling rushed, I felt like the doctor and assistants took their time to examine me thoroughly and listen to my issues."
a2p3g000000KzEQAA0,0011U00000riQOqQAM,"Hours are limited to daytime, no evening available. Doctors are always changing and I have to constantly ""tell my extensive doctoring history"" and made to feel like I make up my pain."
a2p1U000000Ro6NQAS,0011U00000rixpYQAQ,The whole staff was very pleasant and accommodating and I wasn't kept waiting for anything. I  also liked the conversational approach to intake rather than a mountain of forms. The appointment did seem a bit long though
a2p1U000000RpfvQAC,0011U00000riLoxQAE,"I spent 2 hours with the doctor, who talked about himself for 1 hour and 55 minutes of it"
a2p1U000000Ro4tQAC,0011U00000rk5tRQAQ,I am new and can't say a 10 yet.
a2p1U000000RsZsQAK,0011U00000rj0cTQAQ,Personalised service
a2p1U000000Rt7bQAC,0011U00000ri0vvQAA,I think my appointment took more time then needed PN didn't even know what she was doing and they lost my blood work so now I have to repeat it.
a2p1U000000RpzTQAS,0011U00000riqSmQAI,"Just met Dr Carter, really liked her and would revommend her.  Unfortunately the other doctors who have been at XYZ have not impressed town emoyees as being as competent as the doctors they had already been using.  I believe Dr Carter will change that perception with her patients"
a2p1U000000RpakQAC,0011U00000riJx6QAE,The doctors and staff are fantastic
a2p4w000002KHhwAAG,0011U00000riV8DQAU,If they could see Dr Gorman they would love him
a2p4w000002Nym2AAC,0011U000015gzGBQAY,Seems convenient
a2p4w000002NyLQAA0,0013g000007ZZeZAAW,"Prompt to get me in, with the doctor going out of his way to be thorough, communicative and caring. Also appreciate hours of operation."
a2p4w000002NyMiAAK,0014w00002pQCXkAAO,Union members are not charged for the service or pharmacy items. But mainly because Dr Rita Watkins genuinely cares and gives you the time needed
a2p4w000002KIejAAG,0011U00000rj2jaQAA,"Because my doc listens Me, what i need or ask of them and will help me the best he can."
a2p4w000002K6uLAAS,0013g000004FybMAAS,"Enjoy the personable care, not just another number."
a2p4w000002KIgBAAW,0014w00002pPP4BAAW,"Seems really good. Long wait time. Appreciated the thorough appointment, I don't know enough yet to rate higher."
a2p4w000002NyyDAAS,0013g000004FybMAAS,"Like the personalized attention, fairly easy to make appointments, and don't have long waits"
a2p4w000002NzP4AAK,0014w00002pPaOFAA0,all the staff are friendly
a2p4w000002KIuwAAG,0011U00000rjHTrQAM,Everyone is really nice and very professional
a2p4w000002Nz9QAAS,0011U00000rk0GsQAI,Coworkers all know about it. Its a benefit thru our union
a2p4w000002NzrNAAS,0011U00000rjFvEQAU,included in health plan
a2p4w000002NyICAA0,0014w000031g0nyAAA,"I expected there to be a few hiccups since it was the first week with new management. However, the nurse taking my blood sugar could use some serious training. She couldn’t figure out how to use the lancing device. I was about to offer to do it myself when she kind of figured it out. She stuck it in through the cap part instead of pushing the base of the lancet into the handle of the device. As she’s hovering it over my finger to prick me, I notice the needle is permanently sticking out of the caps hole. Typically, the needle is retracted and you push a button that makes it come out and go back inside once it’s pricked you. Nope. She STABBED my finger with it. Worst sugar check ever. Then it was a whole other fiasco watching her try to take it out and put it in the sharps container. Outside of that, it was an ok experience. Prefer the old staff in the office."
a2p4w000002NyToAAK,0014w00002pPaffAAC,"Can’t ever get appointments within a day if sick, phone and virtual visits are worthless. Too worried about COVID 19 to listen to anything else. Never again!"
a2p4w000002NzOzAAK,0014w00002pPawrAAC,"My friends don't work for Weld County, otherwise I would."
a2p4w000002NzysAAC,0013g00000CyFwmAAF,"So far, I like the staff."
a2p4w000002KGIWAA4,0014w00002pPOASAA4,"I feel that the staff is competent.  They are still getting used a new environment and a new computer system.  While this slowed down the visit, I do feel that my time with the provider face to face was productive."
a2p4w000002NzMKAA0,0014w00002pQKjrAAG,Wrong information and I spend 1hour and 40 minutos over there
a2p4w000002O1bHAAS,0011U00000rjS2QQAU,I have confidence in Dr. Watson's abilities.
a2p4w000002NyMOAA0,0014w00002pPayYAAS,Wait time was average.  It was a little odd to arrive 10 minutes early for my appointment and find the door locked.  I called an no one answered.  An employee arrived 2 minutes prior to my scheduled appointment.  I almost left thinking no one was there.
a2p4w000002KGICAA4,0011U00000rk45RQAQ,Very friendly and knowledgeable staff
a2p4w000002O0d7AAC,0014w000031pWl5AAE,Doctors and staff are helpful and attentive
a2p4w000002KKPgAAO,0011U00000riLAAQA2,Good service.   Easy to get an appointment.   Nice people.
a2p4w000002O46CAAS,0011U00000rjWhpQAE,at this moment the biggest concern is the change from XYZ to XYZ i am unsure of the quality of care during the transition
a2p4w000002O10BAAS,0011U00000rikaNQAQ,"It's basically impossible to get XYZ on the phone. I used to be able to call my doctor's office but that no longer seems to be the case. While I can use the patient portal, that's not a substitute for actually having someone answer the phone."
a2p4w000002NzAiAAK,0014w00002pPaN4AAK,If the friend was
a2p4w000002NymbAAC,0014w000031pOGYAA2,I like the way Dr. Connelly explains everything so you would understand.  It. Is very convenient that labs are there too.  They take their time with you
a2p4w000002KAHDAA4,0013g000009jwkeAAA,I have been able to schedule appointments easily and have received the best care every single time.
a2p1U000000RsZCQA0,0011U00000rjaNWQAY,"Friendly people at the practice, and easy scheduling."
a2p1U000000RpCFQA0,0011U00000ri9cdQAA,Because I have had so many problems with the office staff. But I love my doctor
a2p1U000000RtH4QAK,0011U00000rixexQAA,You get better attention.
a2p4w000002NzKdAAK,0011U00000rixeeQAA,"Friendly
Easy appointments"
a2p1U000000RqaCQAS,0011U00000rjzKYQAY,"Great doctors. Very helpful. Very professional. Great listeners. Can't say enough good about the doctors. The nurses are less impressive. Not very efficient with time. Not as professional. Make multiple errors gathering vitals. Very nice, however."
a2p1U000000RqOxQAK,0011U00000ribPSQAY,"I have gone to XYZ one time. It just opened to the City of Arvada employees. I had a full physical and was told I would get my lab results. The Dr emailed me 3 days after my appointment and said my labs looked decent but a couple of values were off and he offered to post my labs on my portal. I replied and asked him to please post my labs. 6 days later my labs were still not posted.  I emailed the Dr and asked him again to please pay my labs. He replied right away and stated """"will do"""". 6 days later and still no labs.  I emailed the Dr again and asked him if I should just come in to the office to get my labs and have not received a response after waiting  2 more days.  I just want to ser my labs!"
a2p1U000000RtUQQA0,0011U00000rioVOQAY,Easy to be seen
a2p4w000002KKYiAAO,0011U00000rjV2mQAE,I like the way that the staff is very knowledgeable in their job and they treat you like family.
a2p3g000000ou9bAAA,0011U00000riRHmQAM,I would definitely recommend XYZ to a coworker but since availability is limited to those who work with me and have our insurance I would not have the option to recommend XYZ to a friend.
a2p3g000000qSPNAA2,0011U00000ricZGQAY,"Personable, professional, thourgh"
a2p3g000000owPtAAI,0011U00000rillcQAA,"The care is personal and attentive and I feel like I get good, solid outcomes."
a2p3g000000owN0AAI,0011U00000rj3WOQAY,"Everyone is kind, and efficient."
a2p1U000000RoiqQAC,0011U00000rjGb9QAE,"Convenient, and quality of care"
a2p1U000000RoOLQA0,0011U00000rjOBwQAM,service
a2p3g000000owNRAAY,0011U00000rjZ0RQAU,Friendly good service
a2p1U000000RsSdQAK,0011U00000rjSsHQAU,pleasant to deal with very courteous and very efficiently ran to me would recommend it to anyone it was a real pleasure
a2p1U000000RqG7QAK,0011U00000riSzUQAU,friendy people
a2p4w000002O04HAAS,0011U00000rjj5tQAA,Nice interaction with the nurse practioner
a2p4w000002O1RWAA0,0011U00000rjjgTQAQ,All persons including the NP were very interested and caring in the best outcome for my health and well-being.
a2p4w000002O0BwAAK,0014w000031r9e9AAA,Needs met. Friendly staff. The registration process was a little weird. The Member Services phone prompts were a little unclear about how to just register as a new patient.
a2p4w000002O1IyAAK,0011U00000rkCQmQAM,No wait time and quality of care
a2p4w000002O2JJAA0,0014w00002pPaQRAA0,VERY ORGANIZED
a2p4w000002O0O2AAK,0014w00002pQNydAAG,It was a waste of time. She couldn’t do anything
a2p4w000002O0KPAA0,0014w000031g26pAAA,Office unorganized
a2p4w000002NysAAAS,0011U00000rhrGIQAY,Very personal. Want to know about my life and not just my health. I can tell they are trying to build strong relationships with their patients
a2p4w000002O1wAAAS,0013g000006NvonAAC,efficient care.
a2p4w000002O18eAAC,0011U00000rjsWvQAI,New doctor is proactive and prompt
a2p4w000002NzdVAAS,0011U00000riornQAA,friendly and helpful staff who shows genuine interest in my health and how I can improve it.
a2p4w000002O0QrAAK,0014w000031g0VbAAI,My medications were not all filled and I had to pay for the ones they did not supply. That had never happened with the previous provider. If XYZ didn't have the drugs they should pay for the prescription.
a2p4w000002O2CmAAK,0014w000031qkj2AAA,"Staff is very friendly, professional, and listens to my concerns. My doctor makes me feel very comfortable and discussing Any issues I may have"
a2p4w000002O0ZyAAK,0014w000031q6k6AAA,"It’s my first visit, so I would like to have a few more visits to form a more consistent view of XYZ’s service."
a2p4w000002O0frAAC,0014w00002pQEvpAAG,Good customer service
a2p4w000002O10QAAS,0014w000031qdLXAAY,There wasn't much true interest shown.
a2p1U000000RswEQAS,0011U00000rj4fvQAA,It's fine
a2p1U000000RtNVQA0,0011U00000rjXd2QAE,"Convenient, no nonsense, affordable"
a2p1U000000RplbQAC,0011U00000rj9HnQAI,I have had both bad and good experiences with the different participating doctors.
a2p1U000000Rt9kQAC,0011U00000rhxGWQAY,First visit -too early for a full endorsement.
a2p1U000000RswgQAC,0011U00000rjDlPQAU,"Went to Health Center at 2:00 pm with symptoms of severe cold or flu; was there for nearly an hour; was prescribed medication, but prescription was submitted to my pharmacy that day;  found out the next morning there had been ""system issues"" with presectiptions;  prescription didn't get sent to my pharmacy until 9:30 am the day after my visit after contacting the health center several times."
a2p1U000000Rsx1QAC,0011U00000riLA9QAM,"I'm not sure yet how I feel about my whole experience. The day I went, your check-in systems were down and poor Mark (Corp building, Louisville) was having to do everything manually. Then I had to take urine sample in a cup, in a bathroom outside of the clinic - so walking around with a cup in a paper bag through corporate office was awkward. Mark was so helpful and super nice, so I definitely give credit there. This was my first experience with telemedicine, and though I do admire/appreciate the concept, it took some getting used to. Then my prescription order was supposed to be sent electronically that same day. The pharmacy did not receive it. It was antibiotics I needed and couldn't get to it until I called in first thing the next morning. Mark again was super helpful. Things were finally corrected then and I was able to begin my medication. I look forward to future visits and I'm sure it will be a better experience!"
a2p1U000000RphIQAS,0011U00000ri6SFQAY,I'm just going there cuz of Dr. Ho.
a2p1U000000l8EtQAI,0011U00000riS1LQAU,Very helpful and pretty open to your personal schedule.
a2p1U000000Rq0GQAS,0011U00000rjks1QAA,Very efficient and friendly
a2p1U000000Rq0QQAS,0011U00000rjLUGQA2,Staff was very nice and helpful.  The business hours may not work for most...
a2p3g000000Kyu6AAC,0011U00000rjGqPQAU,Amabilidad y eficaz atenci__n
a2p1U000000RqfoQAC,0011U00000rjqf5QAA,Dr was really nice and help explain to my 9 year old what was going on with her ears.  Love the one on one time that you get with the dr's makes you feel like they know you.
a2p1U000000RuumQAC,0011U00000rhxu9QAA,"It was a good experience, the staff was friendly and accomidating"
a2p1U000000Rt5gQAC,0011U00000rhzggQAA,More quality time with physician. Don't feel rushed.
a2p1U000000RpbgQAC,0011U00000rk3n2QAA,Pretty nurse
a2p1U000000RvRPQA0,0011U00000riPC2QAM,"I utilize XYZ because it it my employers preferred provider. Because of that, I don't know who I would actually recommend XYZ to. Everyone I know from work already utilizes XYZ and everyone I know outside of work has an employer that also has a preferred provider."
a2p1U000000RoCAQA0,0011U00000rj27RQAQ,"So far, all I have needed is a assessment."
a2p1U000000RqaFQAS,0011U00000rjGDJQA2,Quick and convenient
a2p3g000000KzGXAA0,0011U000015h17DQAQ,The service provided was excellent.  The doctors and nurses were very attentive.
a2p4w000002O4TfAAK,0011U00000rjx2JQAQ,"Never have to wait, excellent customer rapport. I love my doctor."
a2p4w000002O3NvAAK,0014w000031qdHFAAY,"I met with the doctor on Wednesday. She made a referral for a prescription to be filled at the clinic, it is Friday and it is still NOT READY. This is not acceptable."
a2p1U000000RoY7QAK,0011U00000sgzFUQAY,Very kind and professional services
a2p3g000000L1OAAA0,0011U00000riF0EQAU,"You are asking a very broad question for a very narrow available service.      The general public does not have access to the health care that is provided to me through my NJ State Health Benefits Program/Retired State Law Enforcement. I can only refer other NJ State Employees. A very narrow group of working &/or retired State citizens, compared to the State as a whole."
a2p1U000000RpHtQAK,0011U00000ri5mtQAA,Understanding staff and great service
a2p1U000000RpN5QAK,0011U00000rirf1QAA,Great friendly service and experience. Can non-Davita teammates go to XYZ?
a2p1U000000RsX6QAK,0011U00000rjIhtQAE,"I did not see my regular doctor. She was out of town.  I saw Dr. Glaser  instead who was rude, insulting and judgmental."
a2p1U000000RotvQAC,0011U00000ri0vcQAA,The experience was really great
a2p1U000000RsVWQA0,0011U00000sgzHJQAY,"It was easy, convenient, through care"
a2p1U000000RskxQAC,0011U00000riHvMQAU,"Staff seem friendly and warm. They greeted me, introduced themselves. Dr. Muse was very thorough and engaging."
a2p1U000000RpmVQAS,0011U00000riuhMQAQ,"Short experience, but so far it has been great working with XYZ health"
a2p1U000000Rq7NQAS,0011U00000rjcbPQAQ,I like the convenience of scheduling appointments and the onsite availability.
a2p1U000000RoT4QAK,0011U00000rj1ckQAA,Accessible.  Staff works hard to get you in. Great place for routine care and to get direction about who to see if condition is more acute or the cause is unknown.
a2p1U000000RpZ5QAK,0011U00000riKbRQAU,It is because the Doctor doesn't seem to care about her patients and that it is just get in to get over with. Stop pretending to be checking when you are not.
a2p1U000000Rp8YQAS,0011U00000rjhG7QAI,"My annual physical didn't include any type of blood test. I have been experiencing high cholesterol issues and elevated liver enzymes, but this physical didn't even check for my current levels. It felt like I had a visit, not an actual exam. I love Dr Everrett but I am not sure why I came into the office. I could have had the conversation over the phone."
a2p1U000000Rq3sQAC,0011U00000riPVXQA2,It is convenient.
a2p1U000000RsxoQAC,0011U00000rjZKLQA2,I like the staff
a2p1U000000RsTMQA0,0011U00000sh1MZQAY,"Individual care. The doctors really talk and listen to you, they are not rushing off to the next room. The doctors are also very knowledgeable and more open to natural interventions rather than pushing medication. Also, I have never had to wait more than 5 min to be seen."
a2p1U000000RqOJQA0,0011U00000ri16zQAA,The overall experience with XYZ did not meet the expectations that were relayed during the many pre-meetings with XYZ representatives
a2p3g000000oRc4AAE,0013g000007OyUAAA0,Fast and friendly service
a2p1U000000RsTLQA0,0011U00000riA0MQAU,"I like the personal touch, I feel like they are interested in helping me and I feel like they remember me every time I call or come in."
a2p1U000000Rt8PQAS,0011U00000rjesHQAQ,The doctor was knowledgeable and pleasant and seemed like she cared.
a2p1U000000RsxxQAC,0011U00000rjMVMQA2,"I went in expecting my first appt to be a standard 15 minutes.  They were waiting for me, and there was no one waiting to be next.  I didn't feel rushed."
a2p1U000000RpEFQA0,0011U00000risWOQAY,most of my friends already are committed to their service
a2p1U000000RotGQAS,0011U00000rhxGWQAY,Quality healthcare without the wait.
a2p1U000000Rsm9QAC,0011U00000rjiFOQAY,"Appointments are available quickly, and in the time of need. No waiting time"
a2p1U000000RtFzQAK,0011U00000riNVMQA2,Service was good. Had to wait too long.
a2p1U000000RpjJQAS,0011U00000riqwmQAA,"The doctor spent a great deal of time taking my medical history, but proportionately very little time on the physical exam."
a2p1U000000l8AlQAI,0011U00000rhsppQAA,You are treated well and they take their time to explain everything to you
a2p1U000000RvHKQA0,0011U00000rjUPnQAM,"When I took my daughter there for a follow up to an ear infection, we were referred to a specialist. We were not given any guidance or medicine to deal with the pain. I immediately took her to her pediatrician and was taken care of right away! When I went in for a cold and ear ache, I was told to contact the doctor if I didn't get better. I did do that 3 days later and was not given any good advice. When I made another appointment because I still didn't get any better I was told my ear drum had erupted, which is something that could have been avoided with medication. I also felt that I had to ask for medication, considering I just went through this with my daughter and the words out of my doctors mouth was ""maybe that would be a good idea""."
a2p1U000000RqVeQAK,0011U00000ri9etQAA,No waiting and don't feel pressured to hurry.
a2p3g000000KyqlAAC,0011U00001Be7HNQAZ,"the visit was comprehensive, staff was polite and careful, and no copay"
a2p1U000000RqXwQAK,0011U00000rjMBnQAM,I have had great service from dr roberts
a2p1U000000RsmsQAC,0011U00000rj2PrQAI,The hours mon - thur 8 to 5 no weekends.  Not very accomadating!  I need after hours and weekends espeacially on FRIDAYS!!
a2p3g000000Kyu4AAC,0011U00000riUaOQAU,Front desk service was terrible and. It welcoming at all!
a2p1U000000RsRRQA0,0011U00000rjXdYQAU,I like the new approach to care.  I think it is conveniently located and is a great alternative to having to pay copay for care that is not an emergency of if you already have a good idea of what your issue is.
a2p1U000000Rt6pQAC,0011U00000rjRAtQAM,Because I've gone there for a long time and the staff is always nice
a2p4w000002O1ViAAK,0011U00000rjt7NQAQ,Because we were told we would have 24 hour access to the doctors and that is not the case. After hours they have a recording that they will get back to you in 24 hours. That isn’t good enough when you need your doctor after hours. Also there should be an answering service that contacts the doctor and they call you back.
a2p4w000002O39jAAC,0014w00002pQJDhAAO,"Great care, fast and effortless scheduling"
a2p4w000002O2VKAA0,0013g00000CfQczAAF,Quick and convenient access to care and prescriptions.
a2p4w000002KKpUAAW,0011U00000rjmRbQAI,"Fast service, thorough appointment.  Genuine staff."
a2p4w000002O1jfAAC,0014w000031g5nAAAQ,The staff were nice and I felt good being there
a2p4w000002Nze9AAC,0011U00000rjuQCQAY,I love how thorough Meghan is.
a2p4w000002O1cyAAC,0014w00002pQGceAAG,The caregivers are concerned and generally helpful.
a2p4w000002KKK7AAO,0013g000006tcQiAAI,"Until yesterday, it hasn't been a great experience so far."
a2p4w000002O3Y0AAK,0014w00002pQNDwAAO,Staff is very nice.
a2p4w000002O2LZAA0,0014w00002pPb3zAAC,Easy access for employees
a2p4w000002O1shAAC,0011U00000riIWDQA2,The caring part from Dr and staff is what I look for
a2p4w000002O1wFAAS,0011U00000riGcZQAU,Personal attention and a real sense of caring for your condition
a2p4w000002NyEUAA0,0011U00000rhyAvQAI,I love the family atmosphere and knowing that I have “my” doctor.
a2p4w000002KKGyAAO,0011U00000ritFRQAY,It was easy to make contact. Dr. Martin spent time talking to me.
a2p4w000002O1eQAAS,0014w00002pQMQCAA4,Listened to the patient's needs and medical history and patient left with needed meds and treatment plan instead of wait and see approach which makes patients have to make multiple trips for treatment and condition worsens.
a2p4w000002O1aiAAC,0011U00000ri1thQAA,I like the doctor and the staff I am seeing
a2p4w000002O2WSAA0,0014w000031qixzAAA,Because I have had great help with them.
a2p4w000002NyIbAAK,0011U00000rjxieQAA,"Caring and professional staff, never crowded."
a2p4w000002NyE5AAK,0013g000006thZKAAY,"I really like the new doctor, Dr. Stephen Willis."
a2p4w000002O3aGAAS,0014w00002pQBgoAAG,I would totally recommend but I thought it is only open to union members?
a2p4w000002O2qrAAC,0014w000031g3bTAAQ,you get a good check up and u in and out
a2p4w000002O1ZpAAK,0014w00002pQGzwAAG,Never recieved a call. After my emergency room visit told to schedule a follow up with surgeon. Just how does one evaluate with a phone call?
a2p4w000002O3P3AAK,0014w00002pQDPSAA4,Convenient and get a lot of support
a2p4w000002O3KwAAK,0014w000031qLwIAAU,"One visit is adequate to evaluate.
Mandy was very kind & informative.  Mr. Strohl seemed to be very nice too,"
a2p4w000002O21ZAAS,0011U00000rjXZaQAM,"My PCP, Dr. Sean McBrearty, is extremely friendly and approachable; he is knowledgeable far beyond my expectations for a clinic that doesn't even charge my a co-pay. He is outstanding in following up on ""to-do's"" after the appointment and is not bothered when things go a bit awry. He has always stayed focused on the problem to be solved and thinking about the ""next right thing to do""."
a2p4w000002KKVPAA4,0014w00002pPaswAAC,You have poor signage and addressing.  You do not communicate well with new patients.  Your web site showed confidential patient information.
a2p4w000002KKBtAAO,0011U00000rjAP1QAM,Staff were friendly and informative.
a2p1U000000RpvMQAS,0011U00000rk9zmQAA,Cost and convenience.
a2p1U000000Rq8CQAS,0011U00000rjI94QAE,Ok. I called on Friday. The receptionist kept putting me on hold which is find then she said to me that she promised me someone would call me back by COB that same day. They never did. So then I walked into XYZ yesterday and they told me they dont do walk ins which is fine but they always have before. Then I  Hear the receptionist tell the doctor that she was supposed to have called me back on Friday. I hear the doctor mumble something back  to her and as she is walking to open the door so I can go to a room she said to the dr. so what should I tell her that I just started? that i am new here? I was floored. Then just the whole appt was awful. Let me put it this way. I will never ever be back that is for sure! Very Disappointing
a2p1U000000l8BNQAY,0011U00000rj1ckQAA,Doctors appear to be best equipped to address routine ailments only.
a2p1U000000RsVBQA0,0011U00000rjIhuQAE,Friendly staff
a2p3g000000KytyAAC,0011U00000riovVQAQ,"Quick, courteous employees"
a2p1U000000RvCPQA0,0011U00000ripUmQAI,"The staffs at Monroe, NC are very professional and provide fast service."
a2p1U000000RtGmQAK,0011U00000ri5ECQAY,"Took some time to register, problems with payment processing."
a2p1U000000Rt8sQAC,0011U00000riHc0QAE,Good service
a2p1U000000RouRQAS,0011U00000riK5lQAE,They are good at taking care of you in a timely manner
a2p1U000000Ro4pQAC,0011U00000riql5QAA,they are lacked on their responsibilities
a2p1U000000RojEQAS,0011U00000rjwb4QAA,"Most health care choices for my friends are not choices, rather what their work provides - just like XYZ is for me."
a2p3g000000KztIAAS,0011U00000riDPEQA2,"Friendly, professional service but it's a bit further than I'd like and sometimes it's been a bit tough to schedule an appointment especially with the Clifton NJ location."
a2p3g000000oRcEAAU,0011U00000rjcp8QAA,The personable staff are always kind and welcoming to my family. We have never once had issue making an appointment or having to wait before an appointment.
a2p1U000000RoubQAC,0011U00000rjrezQAA,"I, myself was very pleased with the service and care given to me by XYZ Health. While I would share my views fairly with my friends and colleagues, I always encourage them to keep an open mind."
a2p1U000000Rsb2QAC,0011U00000rk8RfQAI,"Dr. Martin was with me on my first visit for two hours, and then called me with the lab results and his recomandations for treatment within two days.Excellent care and knowledge . I was treated great by all of his staff."
a2p1U000000RtB6QAK,0011U00000rihrhQAA,Sometimes I'm completely satisfied with my appointments and sometimes not.
a2p1U000000Rt0nQAC,0011U00000riLUzQAM,"the dr. is great. reception is the worst. they never answer the phone. they seem to be at the desk very rarely & they are not customer-service oriented. (it's not uncommon for them to let you stand there and ignore you for a while before acknowledging you.) concentra seemed to be a little better, even though a lot of the staff is the same"
a2p1U000000l8CMQAY,0011U00000riwDiQAI,It's fine but too far to make it worthwhile
a2p1U000000RpNtQAK,0011U00000rjOJKQA2,I was under the impression that you could do xrays at the office so was disappointed when had to go elsewhere for xray.  I also have not received a call back after leaving 2 messages on the nurse line.
a2p1U000000RoQPQA0,0011U00000rimhkQAA,No GP in West Bend.
a2p3g000000KzFEAA0,0011U00000rhvPgQAI,on time the right $
a2p1U000000Rox8QAC,0011U00000rj7mcQAA,It was nice not having to wait. Also staff took the time to listen.
a2p1U000000RorbQAC,0011U00000rhsCdQAI,Very good service. Excellent doctors and nurses.
a2p1U000000RpCdQAK,0011U00000rjbbyQAA,Doctor is easy to talk to
a2p1U000000RsyBQAS,0011U00000riW66QAE,"The doctor visit was fine.  However, they attempted to draw blood and could not, so I was sent to Labcor to get it drawn instead.  I then had to wait there for over an hour and a half to get my blood drawn which then took 3 minutes."
a2p3g000000L1O3AAK,0011U00000rk7plQAA,"I had a complicated start with XYZ,  my second start has been really good.  Kathleen Hathaway and staff are helping me with a potential medical emergency.  For me...having essentially 2 doctors my entire life (I am 50)...and not a very good patient to be honest...having someone who actually takes the time and walks me through things is a REALLY big deal. So  Katy and staff have been a real blessing that I am very grateful for. I would recommend her to anyone to consider."
a2p1U000000Rsn5QAC,0011U00000rhrIhQAI,Convenient to go there and cheaper with our high deductible health plans
a2p1U000000RtOZQA0,0011U00000rjN6eQAE,Courteous friendly staff.  Individualized attention.  Very detail oriented.  No waiting and no hurrying the patient out to tend to the next one.
a2p1U000000Rt0tQAC,0011U00000rj7n7QAA,"I got in real quick, and I like the doctor."
a2p1U000000RseWQAS,0011U00000rjUmhQAE,Easy
a2p1U000000RswjQAC,0011U00000ri9jUQAQ,Quick to get in and out. Friendly people.
a2p1U000000RoYQQA0,0011U00000rk5e2QAA,Convenience and staff that is personal and professional.
a2p3g000000KyrzAAC,0011U00000riDgCQAU,I am pleased with the level of service but am not one to recommend health care providers.
a2p1U000000RoDcQAK,0011U00000rhwOwQAI,Very complete intake and exam.  Dr. and nurse took as much time as I needed to understand treatment plan
a2p1U000000RoySQAS,0011U00000riAKaQAM,"I HAVE BEEN USING XYZ FOR A FEW YEARS NOW. UNTIL RECENTLY I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THEM AND HAVE REFERRED MANY COWORKERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS GREAT BENEFIT.  MY MOST RECENT VISIT WAS NOT PLEASANT MOSTLY DUE TO THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE BUT NOT HARD TO SEE WHEN SOMEONE HAS A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOU.  SHE SEEMED BOTHERED TO HAVE TO DO A FEW EXTRA TASKS THAT CAME UP DURING MY VISIT.  BLOOD WORK WAS ATTEMPTED TO BE DRAWN 3 TIMES UNSUCESSFULLY. IT IS A 60 MILE TRIP FOR ME TO COME TO THE OFFICE AND I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK.  SHE TOLD ME I WAS DEHYDRATED.  I AM A NURSE.  I WOULD KNOW IF I WAS DEHYDRATED.  I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. ALSO AN A1C WAS DONE AND I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE CALLED WITH RESULTS. I WAS CALLED AND TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO ALSO REPEAT THAT TEST BECAUSE THE MACHINE CAME BACK WITH A CODE SAYING MY LEVELS WERE EITHER TOO LOW TO REGISTER OR """"OFF THE CHARTS"""" TO HIGH.  I DO NOT FEEL IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT.  I THEN HAD MY OWN A1C DONE AND IT WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL.  I THEN CALLED TO SCHEDULE TO COME BACK TO THE OFFICE FOR A SECOND TRY ON LABS.  I SET THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN I WAS GOING TO BE NEAR THE AREA FOR A MEETING. THEN I GOT THERE IT WAS CLOSED. WHEN I CALLED SHE TOLD ME I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE THE NEXT DAY. THIS IS WEEKS LATER AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE ANY LABS DONE.  I WAS ALSO SCHEDULED FOR A MAMMOGRAM WHICH I HAD DONE.  I RECEIVED A LETTER AND A CALL FROM DR KING THAT THEY HAD FOUND SOMETHING IN MY LEFT BREAST  THAT NEED TO BE EXAMINED FURTHER.  NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS WAS VERY UPSETTING TO ME AND I ASKED THAT IT BE SCHEDULED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE MA MICHELLE CALLED ME AND TOLD ME IT WAS SCHDULED FOR ALMOST 3 WEEKS LATER. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED I SAID REALLY AND SHE SAID """"YES REALLY"""" AGAIN WITH AN ATTITUDE. LAST WEEK DR KING RETURNED A CALL TO ME ON 8/17. I HAD BEEN CALLING THE SCHEDULING CENTER EVERYDAY TO CHECK FOR CANCELLATIONS TO GET IN SOONER AS THEY TOLD ME THIS IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE TO DO.  I WAS TOLD THAT MY DOCTOR COULD CALL AND SCHEDULED WITH ANOTHER CENTER THAT HAD AVAILABILITY BUT IT HAD TO COME FROM HER.  DR KING ASSURED ME THAT SHE WOULD CALL THE NEXT DAY AND CALL ME BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY TO LE ME KNOW. TODAY IS 8/29 AND I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE OFFICE. I JUST DO NOT FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOOD SERVICE TO A PATIENT. I FEEL LIKE IT IS EVEN UNKIND TO THEM WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY FEELING VERY WORRIED.  I LIKE DR KING AND I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE HAS NOT CALLED ME BACK AND I WONDER IF IT WAS DELEGATED TO HER MA/NURSE TO DO THIS.  IM FEELING CONFUSED WITH HOW I EVEN NEED TO PROCEED WITH THIS.  I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRUST MY DOCTORS OFFICE AND FEEL COMFORATABLE THERE. NOT SURE THAT IS POSSIBLE NOW."
a2p1U000000RtSXQA0,0011U00000rjaxmQAA,No co-pay
a2p1U000000RpJcQAK,0011U00000rjPLoQAM,Doctor spends time with patient and is thorough with assessment and treatment. Doctor also called patient to discuss patient concerns.
a2p3g000000LAcgAAG,0011U00000rjMBmQAM,"I had a teleconference Tuesday where she ordered x rays, which I had the same day, today is Friday and I have been unable to reach her and she has not communicated with me."
a2p3g000000oRkxAAE,0011U00000rjq5lQAA,Good quality health experience.
a2p1U000000RoyxQAC,0011U00000rjgerQAA,"Pleased with interaction style and initial steps taken. If future appointmenrs follow in the same vein, I will be even more inclined to recommend."
a2p1U000000RsVUQA0,0011U00000rj6cyQAA,bissness
a2p1U000000RpMlQAK,0011U00000rj5XxQAI,Doctors are great
a2p1U000000RpwmQAC,0011U00000rjKyOQAU,Its a calm quiet atmosphere.everyone was very prompt and thorough. I don't feel like my physical was rushed thru just to get to next patient
a2p1U000000RsUAQA0,0011U00000rjyg6QAA,"It's just uncomfortable. Sierra is moody and sometimes friendly, and sometimes not friendly. I could hear her on a personal phone call while I waited to be called in for the appointment. Morgan is very nice and professional."
a2p1U000000RosjQAC,0011U00000rhqY4QAI,Quick service and thorough
a2p1U000000RqJdQAK,0011U00000riRx5QAE,The service level has seemed to decline recently with poor communication.  I would have previously scored >10.
a2p1U000000RpLtQAK,0011U00000riKbOQAU,"Quick, convenient, same day appointment and friendly staff"
a2p1U000000RpcrQAC,0011U00000rjpFiQAI,Quick and easy. Probably wouldn't end up recommending people though bc a lot of emergencies I've experienced lately have been after 4:30 p.m.
a2p1U000000Ruu3QAC,0011U00000rjIciQAE,You can see a doctor at your work
a2p1U000000RsxiQAC,0011U00000riJx8QAE,Caring and friendly nurses and doctor
a2p1U000000RsiPQAS,0011U00000rjJz8QAE,Appointment was quick.
a2p1U000000RoUyQAK,0011U00000rj9T5QAI,"The doctors office has rescheduled multiple appointments due to the doctor being out. This then caused the NP to tell me she would not refill my medicine bc I was inconsistent. However, I have maintained my 3 month visits. And, in my portal, when I look at my appointment history, it says rescheduled or no show on days I was there and on days that the office cancelled my appointments.  I will not return to XYZ."
a2p1U000000Rp8HQAS,0011U00000rjBY6QAM,Service & doctor was good.
a2p3g000000KyprAAC,0011U00000rj2SqQAI,Getting into the Dr office can go both ways good & bad.

a2p1U000000RqZFQA0,0011U00000riBZMQA2,Doctor was nice. Still haven't received my lab test results.
a2p1U000000RqL3QAK,0011U00000rjIcnQAE,Dr. Glaser does not listen.
a2p1U000000RsizQAC,0011U00000rhxPBQAY,Forced into it by my employer.
a2p3g000000KypoAAC,0011U000011ErfrQAC,The personal touch.  I felt like I was viewed as a human as opposed to just a patient or number.
a2p1U000000RpLdQAK,0011U00000rjrezQAA,I've been very pleased with the service I receive at XYZ health. My only minor complaint would be I've noticed a trend of having to wait for assistance when I arrive for my appointment. The staff though are very friendly and do apologize for the wait.
a2p1U000000RpcDQAS,0011U00000rjw2kQAA,Very professional. They make you feel comfortable. They're very welcoming.
a2p4w000002O4VMAA0,0014w00002pPaQJAA0,"they weren't able to get me in right away, I had to wait until the next day and it was at the end of the day."
a2p1U000000RutbQAC,0011U00000risiDQAQ,It's a great service and has reduced our medical expenses.
a2p1U000000Rpe4QAC,0011U00000riewzQAA,"for a DaVita employee with a higher deductible, it saves money."

a2p1U000000RpiQQAS,0011U00000riAKeQAM,Great one on one interaction.   Don't feel like I'm being rushed in and out.  Can talk to Dr. McCay without feeling like I'm part of a health assembly line.
a2p1U000000RscXQAS,0011U00000rht1KQAQ,"I do not work at VelVac where my husband works, and has health insurance"
a2p1U000000RqeNQAS,0011U00000rihrdQAA,"the drs are very caring and KNOW the patients by name. Follow up is awesome, the MAs are great and its pretty easy to get in for an appt and most times be able to get meds right then"

a2p1U000000RtSqQAK,0011U00000rioVQQAY,"The staff was very friendly.  It did take 4 days for me to get an appointment, but otherwise they were very fast and friendly."
a2p4w000002O2JEAA0,0014w00002pPb3hAAC,It is hard to get same day appointments or even next day appointments when feeling sick. XYZ is my primary care physician since I work for weld county and has been for 6 years. Its frustrating to need to go to urgent care to be seen when sick instead of using the weld county clinic
a2p4w000002O28uAAC,0011U00000riu83QAA,I like my Doctor. I will follow him if it is XYZ or XYZ or whatever
a2p4w000002O2VZAA0,0014w00002pPa9hAAC,Ease of service
a2p4w000002O3TZAA0,0014w000031qcBzAAI,Actually got to speak to a dr.
a2p4w000002O3O0AAK,0011U00000rj1nKQAQ,"The patient portal is terrible and it is difficult to contact clinics directly, but the treating PA was great and I was happy with the quality of care delivered."
a2p4w000002O324AAC,0014w00002pPb4cAAC,Friendly and on time
a2p4w000002O36VAAS,0011U00000rhsaUQAQ,Relaxed but professional office.  Seems well organized for my health needs.  Staff takes time and is not rushed.

a2p1U000000RvJfQAK,0011U00000rjxhaQAA,Friendly service with minimal wait
a2p1U000000RssyQAC,0011U00000riKbRQAU,It's mostly the experience. Although with the changes I was still ok with the interaction. Always a great feeling when I see the front desk gal. She is awesome and than the rest is the same.
a2p1U000000RqPqQAK,0011U00000riuNKQAY,Did not like the receptionist.
a2p4w000002O30wAAC,0014w00002jsImIAAU,Dr. and nurse were very nice and informative. Didn't understand why I had to fill out paperwork questioning my state of mind.
a2p1U000000RspnQAC,0011U00000ri9eoQAA,Quick availability  of appointment times
a2p4w000002O30IAAS,0011U00000rjhvXQAQ,no copay
a2p4w000002O38qAAC,0014w000031qDKcAAM,There was a genuine interest in my health and getting to know me better.
a2p1U000000RqSpQAK,0011U00000rjrbkQAA,not sure still filling it out
a2p1U000000Rq4gQAC,0011U00000riFHKQA2,Tacoma and Puyallup are the clinics with best reputation and that's quite a ways to drive for most.
a2p4w000002O2jRAAS,0011U00000rkByMQAU,I don't recommend health care
a2p4w000002O2DfAAK,0011U00000rjZKIQA2,"Friendly, accommodating, personalized attention, make you feel like they care"
a2p4w000002KKdsAAG,0014w00002jsIqMAAU,Convenience and time spent with the Doctor

a2p1U000000RtK4QAK,0011U00000riAboQAE,Felt like the doctor was new and didn't really know his stuff. I'd go back and see if it was different with a different doctor though. The doctor was able to prescribe something that did help with my symptoms.
a2p1U000000l8GVQAY,0011U00000ri3KgQAI,"Dr O has terrible bedside manner, treated me horribly and didn't seem to be able to make decisions on basic tests and bloodwork orders.  However, the office staff was great and Tina especially went above and beyond to make my experience positive"
a2p1U000000RsoQQAS,0011U00000ri1FzQAI,Very thorough and I don't fee rushed to discuss my health issue or concern.

a2p1U000000l8E8QAI,0011U00000rjAP1QAM,Communication was very quick and helpful.
a2p1U000000Ro9nQAC,0011U00000rhsY7QAI,"I really like my doctor. I like that it's a small clinic, so I feel a bit more important. I like that tests can be done on site. I really like that I can easily schedule online and it's easy to get an appointment quickly."
a2p1U000000RoNUQA0,0011U00000ri2f3QAA,I like the generous time that the doctors spend with me so we can have a quality visit .
a2p1U000000RowgQAC,0011U00000riUpWQAU,"good care but a little slow, sometimes I just don't have time to wait"
a2p3g000000KzDyAAK,0011U00000rju11QAA,"The office is conveniently located, it is easy to make an appointment and I don't have to spend much time waiting.  I find that I have more interaction from the doctor that I have experienced with other doctors."
a2p1U000000RurZQAS,0011U00000riuhEQAQ,Very thorough on examinations and got back to me when they said they would
a2p1U000000RsktQAC,0011U00000rj5fhQAA,appointment was quick and easy

a2p1U000000RvFnQAK,0011U00000rj280QAA,Office hours are inconsistent.
a2p1U000000RpfkQAC,0011U00000rjxitQAA,previous treatment of my daughter by doctor when her foot was fractured he told my autistic daughter it was all in her head and there was nothing wrong with her and she was fine and her symptoms were psychosomatic when in fact her foot was broken and had a da** fracture no I wouldn't recommend them to anyone for sh. I only went because I felt like utter poo
a2p1U000000RpqkQAC,0011U00000riEfaQAE,"Well things are never consistent anymore. I have called very sick with bronchitis before and was told they couldn't see me for 4 or more days.  I suffer from chronic bronchitis that is non viral and require steroids and antibiotics , I also have copd and asthma. I stay sick 4-6 weeks at a time when I get it. its critical I get seen as soon as possible. When they tell me it will be 4 plus days we can see you next week that's not quick enough. I have to go to an immediate care center or retail health clinic like in Kroger or Walgreens. Then I try to follow up  and im told again 4plus days. I switched to XYZ health for my primary care and no im just not getting any care. I feel like now I have to go find another dr. Im not happy with Dr mccay either. My polumonigist put me on a 500/50 inhaler and wanted me to stay on it. But dr mccay said no im going to put you back on the 250/50 then my pulmonoigist wants to know why I didn't have a 500/50/ Then also when I do finally get to follow up I'm questioned why I went to a retail clinic for care when they will see me with in a day or 2. Then tell the people who schedule  appointments this.  You all need someone to answer the phone. I always have to leave a message then they never call back. Then im told we got your message we were just about to call you. So I left a message yesterday at 8 am and you can call me back till 4;30pm the following day and then you don't have an appointment till next week. You are told 1 thing on phone and another in person. maybe staff should get together and better communicate"
a2p3g000000LAaHAAW,0011U00000rjgLjQAI,Dr. Fairbanks retired so i need to a new primary and that is hard to establish.

a2p1U000000RqUJQA0,0011U00000ri9etQAA,The doctor was able to spend time with me and listened; I didn't feel rushed.
a2p1U000000RsnPQAS,0011U00000rigCuQAI,"The atmosphere was wonderful, I was surprised at the physician I saw. He made a big change to my medication and didn't mention it. I found out when I received the package for the pharmacy.  Nurse was friendly and took down my history without issue."
a2p1U000000RoGUQA0,0011U00000rjSKtQAM,The people are friendly the office is very clean. The NP the saw me was very professional and was straight to the point about my health she was very helpful and showed she cared about me as a person as well as my health

a2p1U000000RsxDQAS,0011U00000rk8d8QAA,"Although it's affordable for a Humana employee, I believe I got what I paid for, a cheap alternative to seeing a doctor (regarding the support staff)"
a2p3g000000L02mAAC,0011U00000ri2UlQAI,I appreciate being seen fast and doing doc visits over the phone
a2p1U000000RuqBQAS,0011U00000rjJwrQAE,never respond back like they say they do. Get blood work done it takes for every to get results back

a2p1U000000RvGqQAK,0011U00000riYKIQA2,Blood work done for INR.  Blood work was done on 9/23/19.  My doctor did not receive the results until 9/26/19.  INR readings are very crucial to get the results as soon as possible for the patients benefit.
a2p1U000000RqKSQA0,0011U00000rj8TYQAY,"The concept makes sense, but It's too early to know just how it will work out."

a2p1U000000RscLQAS,0011U00000ri0eLQAQ,This is a company sponsored concierge health service.  I am taking advantage of it because it does not cost me any extra money - for no other reason.
a2p1U000000RqCbQAK,0011U00000rjiVhQAI,it is easy and affordable
a2p1U000000Rt6uQAC,0011U00000rk8P4QAI,"My vitality appointment was scheduled for 90 minutes (which is long for my schedule).  I showed up on time and waited about 5 minutes to be helped by the receptionist.  She led me to the exam room, took my vitals, and left the room. I spent 30 minutes alone in the exam room waiting to see the doctor.  When the doctor arrived, she did a cursory exam of my eyes/ears and listened to my heart and lungs.  Aside from the blood draw (which was done during another visit and required me to come to the clinic a second time and this cursory exam, the doctor did no other medical exam and just chatted with me for ~45 minutes.  I don't consider this a very thorough exam and should not have had to spend 90 minutes there and two visits for this level of exam."
a2p1U000000RqcWQAS,0011U00000riy7kQAA,Personal and personable care.
a2p3g000000L1O7AAK,0011U00000rjuD6QAI,The office is location is close to my employer and home. The hours of operation are good.

a2p3g000000oRamAAE,0011U00000rihrhQAA,I like having my doctor and pharmacy in my building. I love my doctor. The only downside is that if x-rays are needed they can't do them.
a2p3g000000LAeLAAW,0011U00000riPFaQAM,Inaccurate information. Biased.
a2p1U000000RsalQAC,0011U00000rj9FxQAI,Only my first time going. Still would like some more time with it.

a2p1U000000RsuxQAC,0011U00000riK5fQAE,"I rated XYZ as a 5 as I have mixed feeling about it.  I love the fact that we have access to two doctors on an on call basis.  However, I leave feeling doubtful if the remedy or diagnosis is accurate.  In the past when I have had family doctors they have been more confident in their assessment and do not ""always"" have to leave the room to research something or look it up on their laptop.  When this is done it leads me to wonder if I needed to come for a visit at all or if I should have ""googled"" the remedy on line myself."
a2p4w000002O4gjAAC,0014w00003GE4CuAAL,Colleen was incredibly thorough and friendly.  Very impressed.

a2p1U000000Rp4OQAS,0011U00000rkAYsQAM,"I believe we have come so far with the knowledge that early detection is the best form of surviving cancer.  Imagine my surprise when I was told during my annual physical, that a breast exam is no longer part of a physical and that the medical profession believes the mammogram is the best way to detect breast cancer.  I am not medically trained, but common sense tells me, a mammogram AND a breast exam by a medical professional, in addition to self breast exams would be BEST practices!  I have always taught my children to partner with teachers, doctors, law enforcement etc...always be a participant in your education, your health, your actions. Taking a breast exam out of the routine physical is a serious step backwards for patients!  I was also told to go to a ""HEAD SHOP"" for topical pain relief, although what is noted in my record says Tiger Balm.  Not sure where a HEAD SHOP is located and positive after looking up the definition I will not be going."
a2p1U000000RtSIQA0,0011U00000rjlZVQAY,Small office is so much more personal and the professional people are friendly.

a2p1U000000RpoHQAS,0011U00000rj3wvQAA,"Very friendly, they called and reminded me because I would have forgot to make the appointment. They are very easy to talk to , and they explained everything so I could understand"

a2p1U000000RoU0QAK,0011U00000riKa8QAE,I went to this clinic thinking their priority was to help me get better as soon as possible.  They were incompetent in getting the results of an outside hospital procedure and have left me in pain for two days without the decency to tell me the truth or seek the results.

However, I had a blood pressure of 140/100 and some of the medication she gave me for possible bladder spasms aren't good for people with blood pressure issues....She didn't explain any follow up plan either...what I need to do at home...so I purchased my own blood pressure cuff (pump kind) so I can start taking my pressure at home...monitor...and then stay in touch ...she didn't increase my lisinopril.

a2p4w000001pnBwAAI,0011U00000rjnetQAA,"This is the second time I have requested to be treated and not received it. The first time I was refused a medication for my eyesight, because I didn't meet criteria for a typical use of that medication, but this was for my eyesight. I did get the prescription from another doctor on Lauby Rd. This time I have sinus drainage, which if not taken care of will spread to my lungs and I can get pnuemonia (happened over the past 20 years) and now I am only going to get a Covid test, even though I have no temp, no headache, no sore throat, no nausea, no diarrhea, and no cough. But the same doctor who refused the medication for my eyesight, said it sounded like Covid and I would have to isolate if I didn't have the test. Since we don't get time off for isolation I have to use my insurance to pay for a test I feel is not necessary, however I will take the test to be cleared. If this sinus drainage does drain and involves my lungs and I am not treated for it, I will have to call the office Again for another appt and miss more time from work."
a2p4w000002KDOHAA4,0011U00000rjqabQAA,"Convenient location, short waiting times."
a2p4w000001pnM6AAI,0013g00000HWehpAAD,Getting a new patient appointment was difficult.  The portal system and video call appointment did not work effectively and forced me to have to reschedule with a different provider.  The provider was nice just not who i was looking to meet with.
a2p3g000000qVcjAAE,0011U00000rk5plQAA,"was easy to get appointment, courteous service"
a2p4w000002Jq8kAAC,0011U000011EkdYQAS,"I came into the office for an appointment and the doctor came in the waiting room and swabbed me for strep, she then sat at the reception desk asked me a few questions, asked me what medicine I usually get and said she would call it in.  She never put me in an examine room, listened to my chest, or checked my ears."
a2p3g000000qTSDAA2,0013g00000CyYNDAA3,"I made an initial appointment with Dr Cryan.  I waited in the portal for my appointment and after 15 minutes, I called the doctor's office to make sure I was in the correct place.  The receptionist told me they were ""planning to call me"" because I had scheduled the incorrect appointment type.  She was not apologetic and did not seem concerned that I had utilized my limited free time waiting for an appointment that she knew was not going to happen.  It was frustrating and poor customer service.  My appointment was at 11:45 am; she had time to contact me prior to the appointment.  So, I switched to the other option I had for a female doctor near me and had my initial intake meeting via the telephone on Monday with Dr DeAlleaume.  She was polite and efficient with my intake.   There are not a lot of options for doctors near me.  My current doctor's office is over 25 minutes from my home without traffic.  The first option was 20 minutes from my home.  I prefer a female doctor and the XYZ office closest to me only has a male doctor.  I am not sure if the XYZ locations are convenient for me to utilize as a primary care doctor."
a2p4w000002JlRDAA0,0011U00000rjJK7QAM,I feel I am getting excellent health care.

a2p3g000000qTMZAA2,0011U00000riBtoQAE,When I was there for my appt none of the techs were able to draw my blood and now I have to go to the lab. That is very frustrating.
a2p3g000000qpfcAAA,0011U00000rjRAMQA2,Close to DaVita & easy to get an appt.  Dr has always spent  a good deal of time with us. We never feel rushed.

a2p1U000000Rpo2QAC,0011U00000riUD4QAM,I like the selection of doctors but I use this service because of the insurance at work. It's hard to leave a doctor after having them for over 20 years.
a2p1U000000Ros6QAC,0011U00000rjw4UQAQ,Very friendly service.
a2p1U000000RorlQAC,0011U00000rjcCzQAI,"Please take me off your list..I will not go back to Dr. Gorman and Palendena in Grand Junction.  I don't think the communication approach between doctor and staff on how to get message to patients after reading important items like ultrasound results is good, and I think he was too laid back just putting notes in their systems about patient can , if further pain, request HIDA scan...poor communication with patient experiencing pain."
a2p1U000000RtIxQAK,0011U00000rjdxFQAQ,"Because Dr. Snyder is cool and so is the nurse who works the front desk.  I feel comfortable there and that is really saying something because doctors scare the shit out of me... just saying, it's a problem, I know.  But it happens to some people."
a2p3g000000KzK0AAK,0011U00000rifbDQAQ,I am not really sure I would recommend this dr
a2p1U000000Ro8VQAS,0011U00000rillyQAA,Follow-up care is not happening with outside consults
a2p1U000000RqAsQAK,0011U00000rjsnQQAQ,Not very convenient with limited time availability
a2p1U000000RuuoQAC,0011U00000rj6teQAA,Very easy to work with
a2p1U000000RtKnQAK,0011U00000rj06vQAA,I love the Doctor I have it's just that referral take a lot of time to get and I have had a couple of issue concerning my medications dosage and quantity.

a2p1U000000Rsg9QAC,0011U00000rhsaYQAQ,Extremely nice people and youre in and out. You do not have to wait a long period of time to be seen and they actually take the time to spend time with you. I didnt feel unimportant or rushed
a2p1U000000RsjsQAC,0011U00000rjwbVQAQ,I like the health care model and so far it has met my needs.

a2p1U000000RtEZQA0,0011U00000riA0YQAU,The physician didn't call my prescription in to the pharmacy the same day as my visit.
a2p1U000000RsToQAK,0011U00000riIWFQA2,Having only one appointment I don't feel I could make a definite recommendation to anyone.
a2p3g000000LAdwAAG,0011U00000riD35QAE,I just did an over the phone consultation I will know more when I come with a face-to-face visit.
a2p1U000000RogZQAS,0011U00000rjf8mQAA,"The staff is nice and spend more time with you. The blood draw hurt my daughter (13) and they were short of shingles vaccine, but other than that, they did a good job."
a2p1U000000RtAHQA0,0011U00000rk2XpQAI,Skill set and positive personality of Dr. Brone

a2p1U000000RoslQAC,0011U00000rjlk1QAA,"The service at XYZ is very personalized, when you are in the office, all area f the focus is on you. There is little to no waiting in the reception area and all of the staff (including doctors) are caring and kind. The only drawback with this type of service is that appointments can be hard to come by if you need to get in quickly."
a2p1U000000RoB5QAK,0011U00000rigHsQAI,Convenient
a2p1U000000RpueQAC,0011U00000rioDkQAI,Professional and quick service

a2p1U000000RpEhQAK,0011U00000rjDo0QAE,"The Doctors are great.  The front office does not seem to know what they are doing.  However, they are getting better."
a2p3g000000KzDnAAK,0011U00001BfQhPQAV,We're very nice and respectful asked a lot questions That I myself did not  think of
a2p1U000000Rt4XQAS,0011U00000rin5eQAA,"Fast,friendly service"
a2p1U000000Rq8pQAC,0011U00000rhw2cQAA,Inconsistent service
a2p3g000000KzD1AAK,0011U00000rjoeHQAQ,Receptionist was very rude and unpofessional.
a2p1U000000RpAjQAK,0011U00000rjKUbQAM,"Not in business of recommending, but get great service, so higher than typical for you."
a2p1U000000RvC0QAK,0011U00000ri6QrQAI,"doctors don't stay so once a relationship is built they move on. I use XYZ because you are easy to access at work. But, you are not my primary"
a2p1U000000Rq0VQAS,0011U00000rjAOWQA2,Good service but won't see my kids till they have a physical
a2p1U000000RobOQAS,0011U00000riaUbQAI,Little experience at this point
a2p1U000000RtGYQA0,0011U00000riCFrQAM,friendly efficient staff
a2p1U000000RseVQAS,0011U00000sgxbcQAA,The doctor is able to spend lots of time with you and really listens.
a2p3g000000oeUwAAI,0011U000019xyUIQAY,"This was a terrible experience.  1) the office itself is sketchy 2) the employee was loudly asking me questions from behind the desk to me as I sat filling out forms in the seating area 3) The Height measurement tool on the wall is put up VERY crooked... she measured me at 6'1/2""  I have been 6' 2"" for 55 years 4) she took my blood and  stated... ""wow, you have a wiggly vein"" and then proceeded to create a ping pong ball sized ball of blood in my arm that, 24 hours later is still painful and bruised    *This is my first experience with XYZ.  Clearly operating as a ""budget"" operation"
a2p1U000000RqatQAC,0011U00000rjS2uQAE,I really liked my doctor - Dr. Muse. And the proximity to my office is really convenient for me.
a2p1U000000RswtQAC,0011U00000rir0XQAQ,"convenient to office.  easy, same day appointment"
a2p1U000000RtTBQA0,0011U00000rjAmtQAE,"I had a lot of problems just scheduling my appointment.   Then after my visit, I was told I owe $4.  Now I could care less about the amount, but when I tried to explain to the person checking me out, that I had already hit my deductible and my max out of pocket for the year, I was given an attitude.  I was again told, ""well that is our agreement with Humana.""  I again tried to explain the concept of a deductible, a coinsurance and a max out of pocket, but was then told, ""Well, it's only $4 so I don't care if you pay it or not.""  As an employee of Humana and as a member of Humana, this is really frustrating.   When a Humana member, has hit their MAX OUT OF POCKET, that means they no longer pay anything out of pocket for the service.   Even if it is just $4.  I just bit my tongue and walked out.   I chose you as my primary care provider, but I am seriously reconsidering that decision."
a2p1U000000RohjQAC,0011U00000rjpFWQAY,"They were very professional,  asked a lot of questions,  answered all my questions.  I was very relaxed."
a2p1U000000RowUQAS,0011U00000rii6DQAQ,If they are in the Waterside building it is convenient and copay is better.
a2p1U000000RuqEQAS,0011U00000riA2jQAE,Too new to tell just yet.
a2p1U000000RursQAC,0011U00000rjXp5QAE,Can get in quickly minimal wait with quality dr
a2p1U000000Rob3QAC,0011U00000rjuWuQAI,"Had a yearly physical and the doctor was very thorough, especially since it was my first with XYZ Health."
a2p3g000000KythAAC,0011U00000rjNtAQAU,Doctors listen to patients
a2p3g000000qC2LAAU,0011U00000rjYfJQAU,I can't think of a situation where I'd be recommending a healthcare provider
a2p3g000000qA8gAAE,0011U00000ri0J4QAI,Only disappointing part of XYZ is that there is not a licensed doctor close by.
a2p1U000000Ro9rQAC,0011U00000rjFsKQAU,"The doctor seems very good, but the check-in   and health history process could be better.  I was mostly done filling out the form, but the nurse instead took it orally.  There are some things I'd prefer to write on paper or tell doctor directly."
a2p1U000000RovjQAC,0011U00000riPFWQA2,"Because of my appointment conflict of dates, where I came in a day early instead of the right appointment date, I was seeing by another doctor in the office, I love Dr. Cook, but when Dr. Ho was able to see me instead of coming back on the right appointment, I felt very happy after my appointment with Dr. Ho, as a patient, I felt like having a second opinion of what my medical issue was really put a perspective on what I am going thru, Somehow Dr. Ho recognize some symptons that Dr. Cook didn't. Don't get me wrong I will still see Dr. Cook."
a2p3g000000pw6QAAQ,0011U000019xyhUQAQ,Very helpful and willing to listen.
a2p3g000000pzadAAA,0011U00000rj2Q5QAI,"Fast service and quality, professional care"

a2p3g000000oRjQAAU,0011U00000ricVFQAY,Cost
a2p1U000000RooiQAC,0011U00000riUD4QAM,Not sure why but most everyone I know has a doctor
a2p3g000000qTP9AAM,0011U000013ktuAQAQ,"The personalization of care. I didn't need to wait very long in the waiting room, the doctor did not rush me, she shared some of her personal experiences with me, and was very thorough."
a2p3g000000qGlFAAU,0011U00000rjhvXQAQ,Caring attitude and good bedside manner from all staff
a2p1U000000RtOpQAK,0011U00000riuiYQAQ,"I was very disappointed with my doctor's visit, which was my first. We had a long conversation about why I was there, including many small problems but mainly focused on an STI test and my trouble with my sinuses.   I requested a full screen for my STI test and they only pulled blood so I only got half of the results I wanted.  I went in for my sinuses and somewhere during our conversation the doctor asked me about asthma and inhalers. I found out that afternoon that she called in a prescription for an inhaler for me. She didn't communicate that to me during the visit and I didn't understand why I would be getting one.  I did not feel very heard or considered by Dr. Snyder, and her communication has been extremely poor around my concerns, both in the exam and afterwards."
a2p1U000000RoHOQA0,0011U00000riao9QAA,Dr. Ho is an excellent and caring doctor who takes the time to talk to you and understand your issues
a2p3g000000qJqtAAE,0013g000006tgJ1AAI,Good customer service and easy to schedule.
a2p1U000000Rsu8QAC,0011U00000rix97QAA,"Friendly, communicative, follows through."

a2p3g000000qB0nAAE,0011U00000riRmDQAU,I've always had a great experience whether the appointment was in person or via phone.
a2p1U000000RodZQAS,0011U00000ri9cNQAQ,"The staff was very friendly, the facility was very inviting, and the NP took her time to understand what my issue were.  Best urgent care experience I have had."
a2p3g000000oRfOAAU,0011U000019xyTQQAY,Flexible to reschedule time  on day of visit due to unforeseeable problem on my part.
a2p1U000000RsW0QAK,0011U00000riK5fQAE,It's very convenient.  By that I mean the location and being able to get an appointment on short notice.
a2p4w000002O4OBAA0,0014w000031rrRrAAI,"It is free, they were very nice and thorough."
a2p1U000000RobMQAS,0011U00000rjdAaQAI,"All staff was knowledgeable and concerned.  Doctor recommended that I talk w/ my primary care doctor, but did tell me what HE thought the issue was."
a2p1U000000RoPXQA0,0011U00000rj8zFQAQ,Dr. Martin truly cares about my well-being and isn't afraid to tell me what changes need to be made.
a2p1U000000RvB2QAK,0011U00000rjRoQQAU,The doctor did not care about my health and finding best solution for my problem. I got a solution of taking pain meds which does not solve an issue only masks it... very disappointed.
a2p1U000000Rt6nQAC,0011U00000riS1TQAU,I appreciate the small family like feel of the practice and the ability to get in an see a Doc sometimes that same day.
a2p1U000000RogpQAC,0011U00000rjnSPQAY,"Easy to get an appointment, Respectful, competent, and professional treatment.  Provided additional information.  Suggestions of other thing to consider for health and preventative diagnosis."
a2p1U000000RurbQAC,0011U00000rk63yQAA,Always seems to be a little disorganized.
a2p1U000000RpoEQAS,0011U00000rigwTQAQ,"Personalized. Relaxed atmosphere, not rushed. On time. Free#"
a2p3g000000oRb1AAE,0011U000019xyPiQAI,"The location is convenient, and I was able to get an appointment in a fairly reasonable amount of time.  The receptionist/nurse was not very professional or friendly.  She just seemed to complete tasks, but didnâ€™t really engage in conversation or explain what she would be doing.  Also, I was called back so they could redo the vitals for my biometrics screening.  Apparently none of the data was saved in the computer.  I donâ€™t have much confidence in this place."
a2p1U000000Rt2uQAC,0011U00000rj4fPQAQ,"Works good for me, but I'm not really in the habit of recommending medical care in any case."
a2p1U000000RtUgQAK,0011U00000riWJzQAM,Convenient
a2p1U000000RqMmQAK,0011U00000riDjgQAE,They don't do anything for you .This was my 2nd time there and I will not be back. I had to end up going to my Doctor and get medicine for a very bad sinus infection and according to your Doctor it was just viral. Both times that I have been to your clinic I have had to end up going to my own Doctor. Which ends up costing me two office visits. My Doctor said to just stay away from the clinic at work.
a2p3g000000LAeaAAG,0011U00000rjJwgQAE,"The process for check in and check out are simple and painless.  Also, my provider, Claudette Jackson, always took the time to listen and address my health issues and needs."
a2p1U000000Rp6oQAC,0011U00000rkBCFQA2,I'm not one to go to the doctor but Dr. Frantz was very easy to talk to and I walked out of Dr. office undstanding what everything we talked about
a2p1U000000Rp8aQAC,0011U00000rjI04QAE,dr. spends time with pt.
a2p4w000002KIfmAAG,0011U00000riYgqQAE,"It's only likely if someone asks, which I doubt would happen. But, if someone does ask, I'd mention the ease of use."
a2p4w000002NyVkAAK,0011U00000rj5mIQAQ,"It sounded great when my the job first announced it. There would be doctors available when you needed them and could get you right in when you needed to be seen, not true."
a2p4w000002NyYeAAK,0013g000006tg2dAAA,My doctor is attentive and takes the time to talk to me about the topics that concern me.
a2p4w000002KE4IAAW,0013g000004FyUFAA0,Dr. Smith shared too much about his personal beliefs and seemed judgmental. This made me feel uncomfortable.
a2p4w000002Nz5EAAS,0014w000031g0tQAAQ,There are some major issues at the clinic at this time.
a2p4w000002NyWsAAK,0011U00000rjrNYQAY,We use to have access at our location 5 days a week with 2 doctors. We now only have access to 1 doctor 1 day a week. The other location is a 45 minute drive away. We were never notified this change was taking place. Doctor has no personality or bedside manner. She types on lap top the whole appointment and dismisses whatever I have to say. its been this way for over a year. I use this service because it saves me money. That is the ONLY benefit.
a2p4w000002NzyEAAS,0011U00000riJ3VQAU,I just don't love traditional medicine in general.
a2p4w000002KFaPAAW,0011U00000rijeMQAQ,"No wait, free (for most part), appt not feel rushed."
a2p4w000002O2WhAAK,0014w000031g2A3AAI,"everyone was nice and the wait time was minable, the doctors are willing to talk with you about your problem and offer solusions."
a2p4w000002NysFAAS,0014w00002pQFvdAAG,Doctor was great
a2p4w000002K64ZAAS,0011U00000rk4gPQAQ,Beachwood Oh location was a terrible experience for me.. Rude receptionist along with doctors who don’t care about their patients at all wouldn’t recommend at all
a2p4w000002Nza2AAC,0011U00000rjfJVQAY,I appreciate the personal attention I get at XYZ. The only drawback is the types of medical services available are not as extensive as a typical PCP.
a2p4w000002Nzo4AAC,0011U00000rjbyxQAA,"Almost all of my experiences have been fantastic. However, the transition from XYZ to XYZ has been rough at times. The staff at my clinic have continued to be fantastic, but the switch in technology (like scheduling) has been bumpy at best."
a2p4w000002NyYyAAK,0011U00000ri30yQAA,"Dr. Martin is caring, knowledgeable, and takes the time needed."
a2p4w000002KKF2AAO,0011U00000rjjgiQAA,Very caring place
a2p4w000002NzlKAAS,0011U00000rjnxxQAA,"I was happy with the visit, but it's my first time seeing the doctor.  I think I'd be better able to respond after several appointments."
a2p4w000002O0GXAA0,0014w00002pQBcbAAG,Not a 10 because the Clinic is just for Utz employees
a2p4w000002NyJjAAK,0011U000017GalZQAS,Very pleasant and caring staff.
a2p4w000002KIgQAAW,0011U00000rjKUbQAM,Great staff
a2p1U000000RohCQAS,0011U00000rjI04QAE,can get in very quickly.
a2p3g000000owOgAAI,0011U00000rjsVAQAY,"Easy access, quick turnaround, great staff."
a2p3g000000LAeSAAW,0011U00000riOYOQA2,I might recommend someone to XYZ if they needed quick care but I would NEVER recommend the Lakewood office: Dr DeAllueme.
a2p3g000000owMhAAI,0011U00000rk5L7QAI,"Recommend to colleague bc we have a clinic on site, which is very convenient, you can just go on your lunch and don't have to take time off work.  Idk how it works if you're not getting it that way through work, though, so Idk if I'd recommend to friend"
a2p3g000000owOOAAY,0011U000019xydqQAA,I only had a biometric completed for my job so I really do not have enough information or experience to rate it
a2p1U000000RvCVQA0,0011U00000rjXd2QAE,Easy to get appointment at last minute.
a2p1U000000Rp2uQAC,0011U00000rj5AvQAI,I prefer more holistic and functional approach.
a2p1U000000RtNWQA0,0011U00000rhxPHQAY,"Great staff,"

a2p1U000000RqP1QAK,0011U00000rjOY0QAM,"Good service, great doctor."
a2p1U000000Rq08QAC,0011U00000rjC3DQAU,Dr. Hernandez's shortened schedule and some lack of follow through between the clinic and my cardiologist's office.
a2p1U000000RtNvQAK,0011U00000rhxuPQAQ,It was convenient for my work and close to my house and the wait time was nothing.
a2p3g000000owNmAAI,0011U00000rhtncQAA,"Your health portal needs serious improvement. For the past three years, it has been glitchy, inconsistent and unresponsive. When I need to request a refill for medication on the portal, I almost always end up having to call because the portal doesn't work. I have tried it on web browsers and mobile sites. How have you not been able to improve the functionality in. all these years?"
a2p1U000000RpEVQA0,0011U00000riHdXQAU,I think my Dr. (DR.G) is pretty thorough. I don't feel like she has to rush me in or out. Thanks Gloria!
a2p1U000000RooEQAS,0011U00000riWyDQAU,"I have had good service except, now, I am not getting reminder calls or email and the nurse couldn't get my blood and I had to come back and wait a different day causing schedule disruption."
a2p1U000000RqU8QAK,0011U00000rj04mQAA,"It took a while to get an appointment, getting a call back or getting someone on the phone is very difficult. However, once I did get in the staff was very nice and the Dr. was great."
a2p1U000000RpDyQAK,0011U00000rixQhQAI,"The service and staff at the office I visited was very polite, comfortable, and personable."
a2p4w000002K2V2AAK,0011U00000riaUGQAY,Provider and staff are awesome always there when you need them
a2p4w000002NzjOAAS,0014w000031qa9GAAQ,It is my understanding XYZ is primarily for city employees and retirees.
a2p4w000002O0dHAAS,0014w00002pQI8GAAW,"Friendly and knowledgeable staff, nurses and Doctors."
a2p4w000002O0ZeAAK,0011U00001An2dIQAR,Took the time to understand the problem and explain the treatment. Very professional and sympathetic.

a2p4w000002O1g2AAC,0011U00000rk3H0QAI,"Really appreciated the deep dive, and the doctor was thorough, even mentioning that my tetanus shot isn't registered with the state. Only drawback was that there were a couple prescriptions that weren't filled before the weekend and I've needed to follow up to get them filled."

a2p1U000000RsyWQAS,0011U00000ri0eLQAQ,This is a concierge health care service provided by my employer - not open to the general public.  Most of the employees at our facility are already subscribers to XYZ Health.  I cannot recommend my friends.

a2p1U000000Rt8SQAS,0011U00000rjj4nQAA,Very hard to find the Rockside Rd location due to tiny sign.  Took 2 viles of blood and bruised me.  Come to find out the tests i needed could of been done with a prick of the finger.

a2p3g000000oeXNAAY,0013g000006tgg3AAA,The availability of the physician and making the appointment was easy.  I feel somewhat comfortable with my chosen physician.  I am sure that there will be opportunities to learn more as time goes on.
a2p1U000000RsZ3QAK,0011U00000rjnz2QAA,"low-cost, high-quality primary care"

a2p3g000000oRb8AAE,0011U00000rjWzLQAU,Great concept.  Looking for stability at the Beachwood location with doctor staffing.
a2p3g000000oRbHAAU,0011U00000rk1cRQAQ,"Very professional,  and personable. I am very comfortable with Dr. Morgan and that is key with me."
a2p1U000000RpFsQAK,0011U00000rkAqIQAU,It's location is conveniently close to work and the doctor spent a good amount of time addressing my concerns.
a2p1U000000RourQAC,0011U00000rj9G1QAI,"Virtually no wait time in the office, doctors are kind"
a2p4w000002O3bTAAS,0011U00000rjSMrQAM,"They are efficient when scheduling appointments, and I always get a response back when I leave a voice mail needing some questions answered"
a2p4w000002O3doAAC,0014w00002pQKyiAAG,Courteous and helpful
a2p1U000000RtN1QAK,0011U00000rjcbPQAQ,I like being able to schedule appointments quickly when the need arises and I like how the appointments never feel rushed.
a2p1U000000RotFQAS,0011U00000rjUDiQAM,"First off I made my appointment with the NP Megan Plunk and upon arrival was informed I would be seeing Dr. Curtis, which was fine with me to see the doctor rather than the NP, however, it would have been nice to be informed in advance.  It would also be nice to be fully informed about the status of the staffing for the office, its not helpful as a first time visitor to XYZ to find out this office is in transition.    Before I go on the the office staff was very nice and professional.  I was not impressed with Dr. Curtis, he certainly addressed my medical issues I came into the office for, although the RX he sent to my pharmacy was not covered by insurance so I passed on that and will follow-up my regular PCP.  When  discussing my medical history with Dr. Curtis, I informed him of my recent cervical spine surgery (July 3, 2018) and his comment was its good to here your doing well, there are a lot of complications that can happen with this type of surgery ""they do not tell you about"".  This REALLY rubbed me the wrong way, I have a great relationship with my surgeon (Dr. Woosik Chung at the Denver International Spine Center) and he has been extremely up front  with me on ALL the risks of surgery verses ALL the alternatives.  I would add that my current PCP has had multiple conversations with me in this regard, prior to my surgery.  Then we discussed my current PCP and how current I am on lab work etc.  I mentioned I have stayed very current through my current PCP (Dr. Roger Mathews with Conifer Medical Center) and that I have my PSA done annually.  Before I could mention I have had very high levels in the past leading to prostate biopsy, Dr. Curtis chose to inform me that PSA testing and some other test are not proven to be helpful in recent years.  This and other comments made by Dr. Curtis using his big vocabulary with medical jargon rather than talking to me in plain English was not impressive (I got the gist, I am an educated professional).  I can speak in lots of acronyms and big words too, however, most people including myself appreciate keeping it simple and to the point.  I will continue to have an annual PSA test done for my own health and peace of mind regardless of the ""current study data"" regurgitated from Dr. Curtis.  I apologize if this comes across as critical, my intention here is to be direct with constructive criticism that maybe useful to XYZ and Dr. Curtis.  I visited XYZ as it is a new offering through my employer Colorado School of Mines (CHIEBA ) and I have been thinking about a change due to the drive I have to my current PCP in Conifer (I now live in Arvada).  Based on this first experience, I am inclined to remain with my current PCP."
a2p1U000000RtHrQAK,0011U00000riny6QAA,"The worst part about XYZ is when a certain office isn't seeing patients that day.  You can go somewhere else, but the point of picking a certain location is because it's convenient to the patient.  If you are sick and that location isn't open, it's no longer convenient."
a2p1U000000RpbtQAC,0011U00000rjcozQAA,"Office staff """"unsure"""" of what and where things are and how to do something."
a2p3g000000oeWLAAY,0011U00000riCSHQA2,"At appointment time they were ready, got me in and got me out in a timely manner."

a2p1U000000RobqQAC,0011U00000rjM7YQAU,"turn around time is excellent!  Staff are professional, knowledgeable, gracious, friendly, and go out of their way to accommodate."
a2p1U000000RszaQAC,0011U00000rjpeTQAQ,"Difficult to get an appointment lately, last month I was sick and had to go the Krogers Little clinic.  Recently call backs and or emails are not always done."
a2p1U000000RpyqQAC,0011U00000rilIYQAY,Promt health care with no hoops to jump through.

a2p1U000000RsngQAC,0011U00000rjAkGQAU,Patient care and doctor knowledge
a2p3g000000KzJnAAK,0011U00000ril84QAA,Everything good except didn't send my prescription to pharmacy.
a2p1U000000RovgQAC,0011U00000rjA1VQAU,"For primary and preventive care, the ability to see  a physician promptly is most important  variable."
a2p3g000000oeWuAAI,0011U0000125IjNQAU,Because twice Leann says they will call me back 8 pm ! Still nothing and SICK
a2p1U000000RoHHQA0,0011U00000rjUzrQAE,Good people.

a2p1U000000RvIhQAK,0011U00000rhsppQAA,You are treated well and they take their time to explain everything to you
a2p1U000000RqF3QAK,0011U00000rjgXJQAY,The one on one interaction is great and its a very welcoming place.
a2p1U000000RoLBQA0,0011U00000rjimOQAQ,It's free but quality of service is not great.  Appointment was available but not at the closest office to me.
a2p1U000000RszIQAS,0011U00000ri9etQAA,"It's a """"closed"""" group so most of my friends couldn't use it."
a2p3g000000KzvkAAC,0011U0000125IrKQAU,"Promptness of service, cleanliness of facility, friendliness of staff."
a2p1U000000RpjxQAC,0011U00000rj7G2QAI,"experience inside the clinic itself was good, however I was given a prescription that was never called in over 2 days and after they were notified that it has been missed."
a2p4w000002O0h9AAC,0014w00002pPaQyAAK,"My first experience wasn't the greatest, but since having seen Dr. Jewell instead of Dr. Peterson, my experience has been so much better.  Dr. Jewell is great."
a2p4w000002KKILAA4,0014w00002pPaROAA0,DEPENDS HOW SICK YOU ARE.  MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE SEEN IN PERSON.
a2p4w000002KKqXAAW,0013g000009gjT7AAI,It's wonderful if you have Cigna insurance. I do not know how accessible it is to people who have out of network insurances.
a2p4w000002KKXfAAO,0011U00000rjzbeQAA,Got in for an appointment really quick and they always are very helpful
a2p4w000002NynFAAS,0014w00002pQGcmAAG,Nurses were inexperienced to take blood.
a2p4w000002KKW8AAO,0014w00002pPaKyAAK,It's the only work sponsored clinic that's at no cost to employees
a2p4w000002O1YNAA0,0014w000031g0h6AAA,They new very little about my visits with CareHere and treated me like a new patient
a2p4w000002O1HCAA0,0014w00002pPZmHAAW,My provider was very kind and understanding.
a2p4w000002O1FpAAK,0013g000002vOetAAE,"convenient, close locations, easy to make appointments on the web, quality of customer service varies"
a2p4w000002KKB5AAO,0014w00002pPavVAAS,"On, 06-21-2021 I called our Weld County Medical Clinic, and no call back tell the late afternoon. 
I had sinus infection, and didn't get a call tell 06/22/21:("
a2p4w000002O2bhAAC,0011U00000rjlzTQAQ,"Scheduling was covenient (although it was broken for an entire weekend of 11/6 - 11/7). Got great answers to my questions, doctor wasn't in a hurry to cram in more patients and you could have a conversation."
a2p4w000002NyGaAAK,0014w00002pQKNpAAO,You have a few real good staff.
a2p4w000002O2AMAA0,0014w000031pT3UAAU,I liked the dr and scheduling was easy.  Only issue is that I would like to meet the Dr the first time dressed.
a2p4w000002O2RmAAK,0011U00000rishzQAA,I Like the new doctor!  She took her time and listened to me.
a2p4w000002NyxZAAS,0014w00002pQBGJAA4,great job allways
a2p4w000002KKFlAAO,0011U000019xyiZQAQ,I waited for over half an hour in the room for the doctor
a2p4w000002O1NtAAK,0013g000007ZXQkAAO,Great staff and great doctors
a2p4w000002O1UzAAK,0011U00000rjwhNQAQ,Entire staff is friend super friendly and professional. When drawing blood and giving flu shots Mica was great! Didn’t even feel my blood being drawn or my vaccinations!
a2p4w000002KK2cAAG,0011U00000rjoKQQAY,"Dr. Glaser made my daughter cry and ruined her birthday. It started off harmless, introducing himself and going over her health background questionnaire. But when addressing some of her concerns, he came across as condescending and scolding her. He then proceeded to bulldoze through every personal  topic with no sensitivity or caution, causing her to cry. He then ended with lecturing her about making good choices in college and warning her about the top three risks of death to a teenager are car accidents (“so don’t drink and drive young lady”); homicide (“do you know anyone who would want to kill you?”); and suicide (your feelings will pass”)!!!! 

When he left the room, my daughter begged me to leave, which we did. 

She has now been depressed and upset for 2 days, ON HER BIRTHDAY, really upset by what some random doctor, whom she had never met, said to her. 

We made the appointment for 1 vaccine. That’s it!! This doctor has so few patients and WAY TOO MUCH TIME on his hands that he is pretending to be a mental health counselor, a GYN, a parent, a coach, and more! Tell him to stick to his practice and nothing more."
a2p4w000002O1j6AAC,0014w000031qVgAAAU,They take the time to listen to you.  You're not just a number to them.
a2p4w000002O1xrAAC,0011U00000rk2JkQAI,My Doctor Retired and I am still checking out the New Doctor's.
a2p4w000002NyF8AAK,0011U00000rjhXSQAY,Dr is very understanding and tells you what is wrong.
a2p4w000002O1l2AAC,0013g000006tho0AAA,I believe I could have had a conversation on the phone instead of going to clinic. It was just one question and then sent to a specialist.
a2p4w000002O1XZAA0,0014w000031r5zwAAA,My doctor I had was nice but the man I had on the phone who scheduled my appointment  was very rude and condescending. His name was Josh.
a2p4w000002NyW9AAK,0011U00000rjL95QAE,"Professional service , friendly"
a2p4w000002NyV1AAK,0011U00000rjXp5QAE,They actually had me in early.

a2p1U000000Rqb2QAC,0011U00000rk7GFQAY,ease of appointments and the ability to talk to the physician directly.
a2p1U000000RsjDQAS,0011U00000rj5mIQAQ,My last contact I did get a call back from my doctor.
a2p1U000000RpchQAC,0011U00000rj9T7QAI,Convenience.  It is nice not to have to leave work for an office visit.
a2p3g000000L2OHAA0,0011U00000rjNznQAE,It's handy and I like my doctor and LPN's.  Only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it is a new way of doing things and I don't know the longevity of it.
a2p1U000000RpWtQAK,0011U00000rjMijQAE,MANY TIMES I CALL AND NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE.  THIS OFFICE NEEDS A DEDICATED PERSON OR ANSWERING SERVICE
a2p1U000000RstNQAS,0011U00000sh1MYQAY,very well scheduled appointments. Dr Miller is great
a2p3g000000LAcnAAG,0013g000006tekoAAA,"Quick appointment availability and provider was helpful, but was confused about how the phone call appointment would work."
a2p1U000000RpvFQAS,0011U00000rjiGqQAI,Slightly unprofessional with the intake process. Could use better customer service up front.
a2p1U000000RtIuQAK,0011U00000rjBbnQAE,I think the office staff could be better trained on professional look and attitude. The doctor is wonderful.
a2p1U000000RppnQAC,0011U00000rifEPQAY,Convenient to get to and always available
a2p3g000000KzwLAAS,0013g000004GwoWAAS,I would recommend XYZ because the staff is very friendly and they schedule appointments quickly.
a2p1U000000RvEMQA0,0011U00000rj4FpQAI,still new to it.
a2p3g000000KyulAAC,0011U00001BeMKKQA3,My first appointment went well.
a2p1U000000RtKwQAK,0011U00000riFsLQAU,"I was told i needed a referral to go see a specialist. i went to XYZ to get a referral and he said 1) you don't need a referral and 2) he just started looking up docs on the Cigna website (which obviously I could do myself). it was a completely pointless visit that i now have to pay for. I am leaving XYZ, having derived no value from the model."
a2p3g000000LAcAAAW,0013g000006tedbAAA,Taking time to hear patient's concerns is a plus for me.
a2p1U000000RsaOQAS,0011U00000rkByAQAU,Doctor was very good and polite! The nurse was not too polite did not speak and let me know what she was doing.
a2p3g000000oRYtAAM,0011U00000riLoxQAE,Terrible doctor
a2p1U000000RsWiQAK,0011U00000sh1MGQAY,Quick and friendly service
a2p1U000000RpriQAC,0011U00000rjnReQAI,"My doctor was extremely chatty. I understand the first visit, there are a lot of questions. But she took over an hour to do this. She talked a lot about her family, that I really didn't need to know. Hopefully the next visit will be much quicker."
a2p1U000000RoeVQAS,0011U00000riEzxQAE,It is easy to get an appointment and I feel like I get my doctor's full attention the entire visit.
a2p3g000000oRdvAAE,0011U00000rjnmeQAA,convenient location
a2p1U000000RpTTQA0,0011U00000ri3vUQAQ,"Speedy appointments, nice to have centralized location for care/prescriptions, in-house testing"
a2p1U000000RsV2QAK,0011U00000rj9hLQAQ,"Dr. Haly, staff, labs & meds"
a2p4w000002O4bZAAS,0014w000031qaFzAAI,"Loved the front staff and the person who came to do the testing.

Then, we had a virtual appointment.  Pretty much told us (after we said we were sick for a couple weeks)  to get rest.  Was shocked they could say it was not bronchitis or pneumonia by just telling me that....didn't listen to my chest or breathing.  No help for a sinus infection my husband has had for the last 3 weeks?  

Then, on my work letter it said due to my unvaccinated status, I need to stay home?  Vaccinated people are getting Covid.  This was not the reason I needed to stay home.  The appointment was a waste of time."
a2p1U000000RsdHQAS,0011U00000rk5dSQAQ,I like XYZ's approach to patent care and coming to our work location makes visits to the doctor very convenient.
a2p3g000000KzF5AAK,0011U00001AnexEQAR,"Son was not diagnosed correctly, office indicated he had a rash, we ended up in Urgentcare 3 hours after office visit and diagnosed with Infantigo after a school nurse said she didn't believe it to be just a rash"
a2p1U000000RqQCQA0,0011U00000rhw2xQAA,Dr Shurek is very responsive to patients
a2p1U000000RsgZQAS,0011U00000rkCQmQAM,Prompt service. She listened to my concerns. Did not seem rushed

a2p1U000000RoB2QAK,0011U00000rjM34QAE,We have to use this network
a2p1U000000RsZQQA0,0011U00000riggLQAQ,"Right now, I have long-time medical providers that I want to see for most of my needs."
a2p1U000000RqS5QAK,0011U00000rjVn7QAE,Always very professional.  Take time to treat the individual patient. Dr and staff very caring.
a2p1U000000RoxcQAC,0011U00000rizBjQAI,Fast simple appointments and service
a2p1U000000RorKQAS,0011U00000rjpeTQAQ,"Easy to get in, friendly, and they take the time to get to know you."
a2p1U000000RsjOQAS,0011U00000rj372QAA,Easy to get  an appointment and the staff was very attentive and welcoming.
a2p3g000000L1OHAA0,0011U00000rjlTDQAY,Odd -- everything I go to visit XYZ there is no one in the office? The care seems fine but yet never seem that busy. Makes me wonder ----
a2p3g000000oReZAAU,0011U00000rk37LQAQ,"Easy to get appointments not too far away, and able to speak/contact practitioner in a timely manner."
a2p1U000000RsQrQAK,0011U00000rj0cZQAQ,I really liked the physician and the convenience of location and appointments.
a2p1U000000RqflQAC,0011U00000rjrb5QAA,For me it is just regarding availablity.  With the Federal way clinic opening it has taken away from Dr's always being available in Tacoma.  Also right now with the village vitality screening seem like that is overriding teammates with real issues.
a2p1U000000RqZqQAK,0011U00000rhwQ0QAI,"convenient, friendly"
a2p1U000000RsoNQAS,0011U00000rj06vQAA,ON TIME APPOINTMENTS AND KNOWLEDGEABLE DOCTORS
a2p1U000000Rpc4QAC,0011U00000riGchQAE,Consistently have trouble getting a hold of the folks in the office and when i leave a message for them to call me back they never do.
a2p1U000000RpWXQA0,0011U00000sgyz9QAA,Personal relationship with a doctor available for consultation anytime
a2p1U000000RutnQAC,0011U00000rjMiZQAU,Avalability is good. Proximity to work is great.
a2p1U000000RqADQA0,0011U00000rhqoWQAQ,It was my first visit and would need more interactions to inform how likely I would be to recommend.
a2p1U000000RoDVQA0,0011U00000rj0xhQAA,Courteous and comprehensive service
a2p3g000000KymAAAS,0011U00000riGt3QAE,The doctor is really taking their time to talk to us as a patient. You feel more appreciated.
a2p3g000000KzETAA0,0011U00000rk5e2QAA,Service is always good and comes with a smile.  Doctors are knowledge and take the time to listen.
a2p1U000000RpJAQA0,0011U00000riWjBQAU,I love the convenience of it being inside my work place
a2p1U000000Rsn3QAC,0011U00000rk10BQAQ,I love that I am to walk down the street and get care asap
a2p1U000000RpBRQA0,0011U00000rjiGLQAY,Very professional and courteous
a2p1U000000RpXzQAK,0011U00000rirCLQAY,Dr. CiCi is great. Dr. GLASER not so much. I had already been struggling with bronchitis for about 2 weeks when I came in & had to see Dr Glasses. He told me to go home & take some Nyquil. Barely examined me. I always request any Dr but him. I've talked to several people who go to Paladine that feel the same about Dr Glasser.
a2p4w000002O3a6AAC,0014w000031qDKcAAM,Rhonda explained my blood results in a way that I could understand.
a2p3g000000KysKAAS,0011U00000rjhvXQAQ,"No wait and conversations with DR, not asssitants"
a2p4w000002O3mWAAS,0014w00002pPagBAAS,"The staff was extremely friendly and helpful! They were able to get me in with only a few days notice. Unfortunately I think they forgot to send my prescription in, as I showed up to the pharmacy a few hours after my appointment, and nothing was there. With the closure on the weekend, I am unable to call and sort this out."
a2p1U000000RspxQAC,0011U00000rjcroQAA,"easy to schedule appt., no wait, the doctor was thorough"
a2p1U000000Ro90QAC,0011U00000rk0mCQAQ,Don't
a2p1U000000RsX0QAK,0011U00000rjdTgQAI,"On this visit, I went in for a Sinus infection.  I did not have a fever, but I do not run fevers with sinus or ear infections.  I have chronic sinus and ear problems and knew my sinuses were infected.  I went in Dr. Glaser, he examined my ears and nose, ears were clear, had sinus drainage but he said I looked better than I felt.  He did not want to give me an antibotic and gave me flonase to help with the pressure in my inter ear.  I left, picked up the flonase from the pharmacy.  Woke the next morning feeling worse than on Monday.  Didn't want to go back to the clinic so I phoned a friend who is a doctor and got both an antibotic and mild dose of steroid to help with the swelling.  The gross mucus that came out on Tuesday and Wednesday certainly indicated that there was infection."
a2p4w000002O4RKAA0,0014w000031qLl4AAE,place is still to new only been there twice
a2p4w000002O3sAAAS,0013g00000CyMG1AAN,Very kind and easy to work with. Everyone takes the extra time to listen and care.
a2p1U000000l8AmQAI,0011U00000rjtibQAA,"From the front desk to the nurse to the exam room with the certified physician, I was attended to thoroughly and thoughtfully."
a2p1U000000RpdwQAC,0011U00000rhq1eQAA,"The receptionist, who was also the nurse, was rude when I first walked in, though she warmed up after I was there for over an hour. They were slow and I don't feel I gained much from my visit. The office was also eerily quiet and they left the door to the exam room open once or twice."
a2p1U000000RpeBQAS,0011U00000riTIVQA2,"XYZ is great for the day-to-day stuff.  I would be hesitant for anything very serious though, both because of availability and confidence in the doctor."
a2p1U000000RoeKQAS,0011U00000rjAOnQAM,"Usually you are good on time, but when I called to say I was going to be late, the office told me to reschedule. When I came in for my time, my time wasn't honored in the same way that I honored the office's time."
a2p3g000000KymnAAC,0011U00000rjGayQAE,Overall very convenient and quick.
a2p1U000000RptAQAS,0011U00000rjkbMQAQ,Appointment scheduling is always day of calling option to be seen by doctor
a2p1U000000RsW6QAK,0011U00000riggoQAA,"Love the doctor,  staff is unorganized though extremely friendly.  do not have confidence regarding proper procedure"
a2p1U000000RpzIQAS,0011U00000rimPWQAY,was fast and easy
a2p1U000000RpZrQAK,0011U00000rjopkQAA,Surprised to be seen by a doctor. Impressed with integrity and dedication this doctor has forÂ the  patient and Bemis
a2p1U000000RpR1QAK,0011U00000rj2mGQAQ,Ease of access to a doctor with quick responses.
a2p1U000000Rq9LQAS,0011U00000riPmPQAU,I received very good care while I was there. The doctor and nurse were kind and made me feel comfortable.
a2p1U000000Ro8TQAS,0011U00000rjNznQAE,It's a great way to do things
a2p1U000000RovbQAC,0011U00000ri4GJQAY,DIDNT FEEL LIKE A NUMBER GETTING PASSED ON
a2p3g000000LAb5AAG,0011U00000ritf0QAA,"Call you on time, very professional and friendly."
a2p1U000000Rp7lQAC,0011U00000riLTmQAM,"Dr. Lee was very professional and approachable. She answered all my questions, and never made me feel bad about myself or my health. She read my body language and made suggestions that didn't make me feel threatened or attacked. If she didn't feel comfortable prescribing a solution, she offered to refer me to a specialist that would have the resources to help me. I plan to go back to her for all of my general medical needs."
a2p1U000000RsarQAC,0011U00000rjp3pQAA,"I didn't wait very long when I arrived, I also really liked Dr. Martin, he was very knowlegable and very  personable"
a2p3g000000KzoMAAS,0011U00000rkAXqQAM,I like my doctor
a2p1U000000Ro5jQAC,0011U00000rjabkQAA,"After the appointment I usually need to go elsewhere so I have 2 appointments instead of one, that's a waste of time."
a2p1U000000RvGvQAK,0011U00000rjqQyQAI,Convenience.
a2p3g000000L1OGAA0,0011U00000riW6OQAU,"Service is fast, professional, and friendly"
a2p1U000000Rp21QAC,0011U00000rin09QAA,Office clean and modern. Desk people friendly and helpful.  Doctor thorough and personable.
a2p1U000000Rsl9QAC,0011U00000riFsLQAU,"I never get calls back from XYZ when they say they're going to call me. Literally, never. This time Dr. Roberts said she'd be calling with results in a day or two and it's now three days later and I haven't heard from her. Every time I saw Dr. Muse the same thing -- never heard back within the time they said, and sometimes never heard back at all."
a2p1U000000RosBQAS,0011U00000ripneQAA,It was easy to get an appointment. The Dr. gave me the time I needed and answered all my questions.
a2p1U000000RosGQAS,0011U00000rk6PYQAY,"scheduling is easy, online system friendly. It seems like there has been a lot of turnover. I joined XYZ for a doc at the Cap Hill location who promptly left. Found Dr. Roberts, who then left, and I am now on my third doc."
a2p1U000000RojIQAS,0011U00000rhsqFQAQ,Availability
a2p1U000000RsUZQA0,0011U00000ri2ezQAA,it was ok. nothing special. I liked my previous doctor better. didn't like being at work and in the waiting room at the same time.
a2p1U000000RsUMQA0,0011U00000rjZgAQAU,They seemed unsure that I had an appointment after resceduling me.  Then the nurse asked me questions she claimed were not in my chart but I could see the records with the answer.  I did not feel the room was private and the nurse kept telling me to whisper my information instead of speaking in a normal voice.  I prefer to use my primary care doctor who I have used for 20 years.
a2p1U000000RqYkQAK,0011U00000rk1yUQAQ,"Ease of access, great physician relationship"
a2p1U000000RtRSQA0,0011U00000rj5JiQAI,Don't know enough yet
a2p3g000000L2xQAAS,0011U000011Ekj7QAC,office is within my area.
a2p1U000000Rt9VQAS,0011U00000ripE1QAI,"My new doctor was awesome, answered all my silly questions and was able to get me in quickly. Also gave me a quick solution which  I appreciated"
a2p4w000002O3DRAA0,0014w00002pQKPvAAO,"Fast thorough, friendly, informative
Helpful, resourceful"
a2p4w000002O3XHAA0,0014w00002pQGOEAA4,I am still getting used to your services since you are new to my clinic
a2p1U000000RoOYQA0,0011U00000rj8TSQAY,I am not happy with Dr. Thomas or Kathleen Hathaway in not listening to me when I k ow my body
a2p1U000000RqWQQA0,0011U00000riA2oQAE,"I respect my employer, the City of Arvada, for doing what it can to keep health costs down.  It is great that XYZ is free and close.  I am not, however, very impressed with the quality of Dr. Shuherk's professionalism, based on what I have experienced so far."
a2p1U000000RsmiQAC,0011U00000rjvlfQAA,Customer service. Personal attention. Good priorities.
a2p4w000002O3A3AAK,0013g000004DP2yAAG,"great service, easy access, timely communication"
a2p1U000000RsdWQAS,0011U00000rjFvEQAU,my colleges already know about the service and many have used it more than I.
a2p4w000002O39ZAAS,0011U00000riMYXQA2,I don't know anyone with the same insurance. But if someone were to ask I'd recommend my doctor to someone.
a2p1U000000RoYZQA0,0011U00000rio6cQAA,I felt there was concern for my health. I don't think I have any health issues. I had blood work done and the doctor and his assistant spent 1.5 hours with me. This was my first visit.
a2p4w000002O3qsAAC,0011U00000risBkQAI,Convenience
a2p4w000002O2nJAAS,0014w000031g12WAAQ,"Everyone is polite, respectful,  and courtesy."
a2p1U000000RvfqQAC,0011U00000rjTU9QAM,The one-on-one interaction with the doctors is great. Mine spent 1 1/2 hrs with me at my first visit.
a2p4w000002O2aPAAS,0014w000031qlzjAAA,My whole visit was a circus
a2p4w000002O2y2AAC,0014w00002pQKXUAA4,No waiting time and good employees
a2p1U000000RtMEQA0,0011U00000rjgX8QAI,"I have really appreciated XYZ's approach to medicine since becoming a patient last year. I had previously visited Dr. Muse's clinic downtown, so my visit to the Greenwood Village clinic was very different. I had to wait nearly 45 minutes to be seen by the Dr. after arriving on-time for my appointment. Not too mention that the office manager/assistant's presence was tense and disorganized, which did not improve my experience."
a2p4w000002O31BAAS,0014w00002pPatgAAC,It was a little concerning that the records from the previous Clinic did not carry over.
a2p3g000000KynvAAC,0011U00000rjWi0QAE,"I liked my previous doctor Dr. Song, but everything has been a hassle for us since she left."
a2p1U000000RoQOQA0,0011U00000rjCJKQA2,I have no preference
a2p1U000000Rt9JQAS,0011U00000rkCQmQAM,Fast service and not feeling rushed by the doctor
a2p1U000000Ro4aQAC,0011U00000rjDoCQAU,Wait time was a lot longer then expected. Poor follow up on treatment after appointment.
a2p1U000000RsSCQA0,0011U00000ri6nRQAQ,Financially makes sense. The physicians are well qualified.
a2p1U000000Rt8bQAC,0011U00000riOnqQAE,Ease. Convenience. Good care. Low cost.
a2p1U000000Rq2OQAS,0011U00000rj5mIQAQ,They were able to get me in even though there was an issue with my insurance
a2p1U000000RoaHQAS,0011U00000rivKgQAI,Seems like a well organized office
a2p1U000000RoImQAK,0011U00000rjSKqQAM,I like the availability and easiness of contacting XYZ doctors. Also really low wait times.
a2p1U000000RtIrQAK,0011U00000riZpOQAU,Individual attention.  Very convenient (get meds there)
a2p1U000000RsacQAC,0011U00000rinNOQAY,So far I enjoy the one on one attention from the staff.
a2p3g000000LAboAAG,0011U00000rjUmgQAE,I like the people but It seems like sometimes you get herded through.
a2p1U000000RsyKQAS,0011U00000rjsnQQAQ,Dr. D is very knowledgeable and reply in a timely manner.
a2p1U000000RoPHQA0,0011U00000rijOPQAY,I love the amount of time I am able to spend with providers through XYZ and the personal care.
a2p1U000000RpcqQAC,0011U00000riNATQA2,Quick and easy
a2p1U000000RqVfQAK,0011U00000ri9etQAA,I like Dr. Brone.  I just don't talk to that many people about what doctor I see.
a2p1U000000RtT8QAK,0011U00000rjdxnQAA,Convenience
a2p1U000000RoSLQA0,0011U00000risCEQAY,Convenient location for employees. Usually don't have to wait very long for an appointment.
a2p1U000000RpR4QAK,0011U00000rjUmhQAE,To long of a time to get in touch with a medical person when there is medical advise or appointment needed
a2p1U000000Rt1qQAC,0011U00000rjmSNQAY,It's very convenient and I am treated well.
a2p1U000000RtQFQA0,0011U00000riNHvQAM,"The staff was real friendly, But seemed real rushed"
a2p1U000000RqYhQAK,0011U00000sgyVyQAI,"I like the ease of making an appointment and the amount of time my Dr spent with me.  Parking is kind of difficult, though..."
a2p1U000000Rp4aQAC,0011U00000rikZwQAI,I like that it's personal and you feel like the time there is didacted to you.
a2p1U000000Rpp2QAC,0011U00000rj7fiQAA,The physician was really nice and friendsly.she made suggestions and useful advises.
a2p3g000000KzqRAAS,0011U00000riqK2QAI,"Affordable care, easy to schedule online appointments, friendly staff and doctor."

a2p1U000000RokCQAS,0011U00000riuNZQAY,"Great doctors, you can call them any time."
a2p1U000000RqbMQAS,0011U00000rjTyfQAE,Great service and doctors
a2p3g000000KyscAAC,0011U00000rjCsyQAE,Extremely affordable. Personal care.  Medications available on-site.   Lowered score because telephone messages and emails left with office staff frequently go unanswered.
a2p3g000000KzvlAAC,0011U00000rjjMmQAI,"Great providers, efficient and timely appointments"
a2p1U000000RoEIQA0,0011U00000rjqfBQAQ,Son muy amables el personal. Yte ayudan en todo
a2p1U000000RpeVQAS,0011U00000rjvTDQAY,I have never had a negative experience. I always get a thorough examination and the doctor I see gives me feedback for how to help with my medical problem no matter what it is and has given internet printouts with suggestions.
a2p1U000000RsUeQAK,0011U00000ricZEQAY,Very nice and helpful nurse and Dr.Haley is Great !!!!
a2p1U000000RsVTQA0,0011U00000rj6cyQAA,many of the fellow employees do not see the benefit of this service as i. they have a perception it is not a long lasting solution to the heath system we are in being that a doctor left XYZ and the town has changed the wellness program many times.
a2p1U000000RtBTQA0,0011U00000rj5mIQAQ,It is always nice for the front office staff to call you by name when you enter the office. It is great that they did the pictures when you first go in.
a2p1U000000Rt91QAC,0011U00000rk2CWQAY,Dr. Glaser spent a good deal of time with me discussing my concerns.  He was very thorough.
a2p3g000000L1O9AAK,0013g000003or5wAAA,Convenient. I like the provider. Responsive.
a2p1U000000RscRQAS,0011U00000rjF5rQAE,The doctor is really nice
a2p3g000000oeUxAAI,0011U000019xyemQAA,The office was disorganized behind the desk.  With a stuffed item that resembled a pile of Poo.  The examination room was dingy.  An empty vial was dropped on floor and never picked up while I waited for the doctor.  I did not see nor verify my name on the blood draw vial.  The doctor and nurse were very personable though.
a2p4w000002O4AsAAK,0011U00000rjWx9QAE,My first visit and felt like I would be comfortable using this facility
a2p1U000000RoyLQAS,0011U00000rjPKzQAM,Friendly staff and doctors.  I feel the doctor always listens to me.  I don't feel rushed.

a2p1U000000RpBXQA0,0011U00000rirfGQAQ,easy to establish appointments.  convenient.  Can be seen quickly
a2p3g000000oRoUAAU,0011U00000rjoljQAA,Seems like a good value
a2p1U000000RtAZQA0,0011U00000rjXdUQAU,"Dr spend plenty of time, thorough exploration of issues"
a2p1U000000RvP9QAK,0011U00000riLrSQAU,"I just didn't  feel as your care facility was projected to be. Maybe because I have a ""PCP"" and it was taken as that which XYZ Health would be the secondary. But what if I wanted to change....... Well just didn't  feel as if I was fully appreciated, but will visit  again in future and see if my feelings change."
a2p1U000000RqH7QAK,0011U00000ri3KcQAI,Easy to make an appointment same day. Staff was friendly. Only complaint was how loud the staff was in back chatting while I was waiting in the waiting room.
a2p1U000000RovZQAS,0011U00000riEIRQA2,It is convenient and economical.
a2p1U000000RsXRQA0,0011U00000rizBlQAI,Great Doctor and Nurses
a2p3g000000KyvEAAS,0011U00000riR0TQAU,Staff is excellent but may not have all the equipment needed as most other clinics do...
a2p1U000000RpNeQAK,0011U00000rjI04QAE,doctor spends time with you to answer all your questions
a2p1U000000RpZlQAK,0011U00000riSzEQAU,"Pleasant experience, fast,"
a2p1U000000RqQaQAK,0011U00000riXeCQAU,Good doctor
a2p1U000000RtIRQA0,0011U00000riytPQAQ,friendly very informed
a2p3g000000KztDAAS,0011U00000rhsv9QAA,I was really happy I could get a phone appointment with an actual physician to establish myself with a primary care physician for the first time in five years. And it was a next day appointment. Also the appointment was very thorough.
a2p1U000000RoKYQA0,0011U00000rkBU9QAM,"Inexpensive, fast, easy, very friendly and competent staff."
a2p1U000000Rse6QAC,0011U00000rjHoFQAU,I liked the amount of time Dr. DeAlleaume spent with me.
a2p1U000000Rp1nQAC,0011U00000rj4LLQAY,Think the idea is good but my experience wasn't what I had hopped it would be
a2p1U000000RoUDQA0,0011U00000ri3V4QAI,Only prefer certain doctors at the health clinics. Have had an experience where I felt like I was not really any sort of priority to the doctor that was helping me.
a2p1U000000RpzPQAS,0011U00000rjErJQAU,"I love the idea and the staff was great, but the hours are not very convenient"
a2p1U000000Ro8uQAC,0011U00000rkBMyQAM,"I like the idea of showing up at your appointment and actually getting in on time.  Having a ""one stop"" health care facility; blood work, ekg, etc is efficient and frugal"
a2p1U000000RpE7QAK,0011U00000rj8p9QAA,Good for basic treatments
a2p3g000000KzpiAAC,0011U00000rhvn6QAA,Office visit is timely
a2p1U000000Rt5iQAC,0011U00000rioENQAY,Can't think about anything bad.
a2p1U000000Rpd1QAC,0011U00000rjA1UQAU,I find the communication skills and bedside manner of my provider to be excellent.
a2p1U000000RtA3QAK,0011U00000rjAQBQA2,Trust Dr Ritter. Exam thorough.
a2p3g000000oeXBAAY,0013g000002vQqxAAE,I haven't met with my doctor in person yet but both doctors I spoke to for 1 hour each were very kind and helpful.  I really felt good after I spoke to both of them.
a2p3g000000oRlpAAE,0011U00000rjUmQQAU,Friendly and fast. The doctors take the time to listen.
a2p1U000000RqdkQAC,0011U00000rjzgFQAQ,The staff and Dr. Cameron are very welcoming and provide great care.
a2p1U000000RspzQAC,0011U00000rjGspQAE,Dr Brone has poor bedside manner. Speaks condescending to patients and does not listen.
a2p1U000000RpOLQA0,0011U00000riPXrQAM,"-Convenient to go during the workday. -Facility is really nice, modern, and clean. (I like that the exam rooms are like a suite with a couch to give less of that ""clinical"" feel.) -I love that the doctor shares his knowledge very well and explains a lot o"
a2p1U000000RoTLQA0,0011U00000rjBOqQAM,I have only had 1 experience with XYZ.
a2p1U000000RsuyQAC,0011U00000rk4nOQAQ,Satisfied with service/treatment
a2p1U000000Ro5IQAS,0011U00000riBtoQAE,I like the drs I've seen
a2p3g000000KzCoAAK,0011U00000rkBYPQA2,convenient and reliable
a2p3g000000Kyt5AAC,0011U00001BfuiTQAR,My initial appointment was very good - but I need to be with you for awhile before I would feel comfortable making a strong recommendation.
a2p3g000000oRbBAAU,0013g000006tehqAAA,Prompt & courteous service.
a2p1U000000RomUQAS,0011U00000rk4LpQAI,"It is easy to get in, the staff is friendly and the doctor is professional."
a2p3g000000L1PjAAK,0013g000006NtuxAAC,Doctor Davidson seems to be an excellent provider
a2p1U000000Rt8eQAC,0011U00000ri6QrQAI,not enough experience with XYZ
a2p1U000000RqSmQAK,0011U00000rj2QVQAY,"I have called twice for appointments, once last year when I was sick and once this year to get in for a flu shot.  Both times it took 24 hours to get back to me because nobody was in the office that day.  XYZ was touted as being a solution for getting in quickly for little things like this.  Frankly it is easier to just go to my doctor."
a2p3g000000ouBDAAY,0011U00000rjEwqQAE,My provider Dr. Hester is great! She is personable and honest. She works with me to outline the best care plan going forward.
a2p3g000000p4OKAAY,0011U00000rk3RrQAI,The nurse practitioner was great. But we suddenly got disconnected and I never received a call back. I called several times and didn't receive a returned phone call by an administrator until very late in the day. I asked that the practitioner return the call so we could finish the discussion. I didn't get a call back until the next day half hour before closing. I missed the call by 45 minutes when the office was already close so I had to wait the weekend until the office reopened and I could talk to someone else.
a2p3g000000owOeAAI,0011U00000rjbejQAA,They listen to you and they care
a2p3g000000puVOAAY,0013g0000091uYVAAY,I like the concept. Dont like that you don't accept Medicare.
a2p3g000000pW60AAE,0011U00000rirQvQAI,people are great.  very nice and accomodating
a2p3g000000owMNAAY,0011U00000rjJwwQAE,The promptness to get an appointment
a2p3g000000pYqjAAE,0013g000007ZZQRAA4,Very polite and doctor was so nice.
a2p3g000000pZAFAA2,0011U000019xys0QAA,the jury is out... so far
a2p3g000000pAm9AAE,0013g000004CsldAAC,"Just returning as a patient.  Only experience so far was flu shot. That experience was great...for a shot, anyway :-)"
a2p3g000000prgdAAA,0013g000006uJTmAAM,Still new to me.. seemed very helpful however
a2p3g000000p02HAAQ,0011U00000rj8SxQAI,Friendly staff
a2p3g000000p4MsAAI,0011U000019xycaQAA,I found my experience with my primary care Dr. and his nurse pleasurable and relaxing. I felt cared for.
a2p3g000000pIqYAAU,0011U00000rjGN5QAM,The personnel I encountered were very courteous.
a2p3g000000owNUAAY,0011U00000riIP5QAM,"Great, thoughtful service once I was able to complete my  appointment"
a2p3g000000owKMAAY,0013g000006tfa3AAA,Limited experience with doctors to give a 10
a2p3g000000pPHpAAM,0011U00001Be7HNQAZ,"Fast, knowledgeable"
a2p3g000000oxJUAAY,0011U000019xyPsQAI,Wasn't impressed with the facility

a2p3g000000prdjAAA,0013g000009jwixAAA,Like the doctor
a2p3g000000pg3QAAQ,0011U00000riwUoQAI,"I am extremely satisfied with my provider, Dr. Gray, his MA and the overall office patient visit experience.  But, my recent experience with the XYZ patient portal sucks...I am extremely dissatisfied. No communication of update/change, and despite my contact with the ""help line"" I am still unable to log-in.  It is clear that this new merger experience and work with the IT team is not beneficial to XYZ Health."
a2p4w000001pt1sAAA,0013g00000CxT1oAAF,I only had one visit so far.
a2p4w000002KFb8AAG,0011U00000rjIQwQAM,Friendly
a2p4w000002K6sjAAC,0011U000019xyUAQAY,"The facility is in a completely random building, the technology of equipment is outdated, and communication from the company is not very effective."
a2p4w000001pv4oAAA,0013g000006thLlAAI,The damn office is over 100 miles from my home.
a2p4w000001ppOnAAI,0011U00000ri3gDQAQ,Clean facility nicest staff ever which is extremely important to me and dr thoroughly explains things n asks how you are and cares. Hope my dr stays around a long time.
a2p4w000002Jv8GAAS,0011U00000rk68CQAQ,I like the doctors and his assistant is nice but couldn't draw my blood and was hesitant to try a second time; told me I could go to a lab to have it drawn.  And whether she forgot or didn't know to give me my 2 shots (shingles & pneumonia) I had discussed with the doctor.
a2p4w000001plJeAAI,0011U00000rjV26QAE,Staff very friendly  and helpful and quick The Doctor is awsome as well
a2p4w000002K5EsAAK,0011U00000riuhsQAA,"It seems as though the practitioner really values you as a person rather than a """"patient"""" and they have a half-hour to discuss issues. They are thorough in their questions and follow-up."
a2p4w000001q0u6AAA,0013g000005GJxxAAG,"Helpful and friendly staff, super convenient to my office"
a2p4w000002K712AAC,0011U0000125IggQAE,My friends do not qualify as a City of Akron or Akron School system employee.  Out of pocket cost to join would be prohibitive.
a2p4w000001prUTAAY,0011U00000rj5kRQAQ,Good staff and okay locations
a2p4w000002JwdjAAC,0011U00000rkBYaQAM,easy to get an appointment. They spend the needed amount of time to find out what health problems you may be having and what you can do to correct them.
a2p3g000000qkivAAA,0011U00000rjCy7QAE,"I pretty much self diagnosed myself, and then they called back with as different plan. So I called back after a voicemail, v and 2.5 hrs they got back to me. Sorry, but I have better things to do with my time"
a2p4w000002Jq5CAAS,0011U00000riQP0QAM,The personnel is nice and competent
a2p4w000002KHcSAAW,0011U00000rj6BSQAY,"There is usually no waiting to get in, you get good treatment from staff and it is more of a laid back environment"
a2p4w000001pmJ6AAI,0013g0000091fF0AAI,"Dr. Pearl could of been a bit kinder, and more personable. I really don't know if I'll be returning."
a2p4w000001prS3AAI,0011U00001An2cSQAR,Very good staff and very prompt
a2p3g000000qdmMAAQ,0011U00000rjuj6QAA,"Great patient concern, wellbeing, follow up."
a2p1U000000RpF6QAK,0011U00000rii9cQAA,Very thorough and very friendly
a2p1U000000Ro74QAC,0011U00000rixexQAA,My past experience with them was exceptional and hadn't had service like that before.
a2p3g000000oeXEAAY,0011U00000rjmRbQAI,"Although I felt I received great care, I was concerned with the lack of hand washing/hand sanitizing with each procedure.  I did not view anyone washing their hands / hand sanitizing prior to working with me and that terrifies me.    Although the staff was very pleasant, I felt uncomfortable at times during the processes, I feel the MA seemed very uncertain as to what she was doing and may have even seemed to be grossed at a moment in time while performing a procedural test.  Made me wonder the qualifications of who was helping with my treatment."
a2p1U000000RqTsQAK,0011U00000riewOQAQ,"They're convenient to our workplace, it's easy to get appointments, and you get real time with the doctor"
a2p1U000000RqNUQA0,0011U00000rjjxsQAA,Good doctor
a2p1U000000RoDbQAK,0011U00000rjHRRQA2,"Having a doctor on call is convenient, however the appointment times are not particularly convenient. Also, the level of the doctor's knowledge is very basic."
a2p1U000000RtRBQA0,0011U00000risE2QAI,It felt very personable to me. They were big on prevention and helping me not just treating the symptoms and getting me out the door.
a2p1U000000RqHjQAK,0011U00000riAvCQAU,MD provided very thorough assessment Very friendly Very clean office
a2p1U000000Rt3PQAS,0011U00000rk45MQAQ,the doctor appeared to be impatient and unempathetic with my struggles to change habits that are affecting my health. The doctor was curt at times and stern. This type of dynamic and atmosphere does not facilitate change  as evidenced by the research on how humans change.
a2p1U000000RowBQAS,0011U00000riHdfQAE,"For the first time in a long time, I felt valued."
a2p1U000000RsguQAC,0011U00000riMCFQA2,The process of patient evaluation is much too long. I've been approximately 4 months in the process of evaluation of a serious illness. The clinic does not have sufficient resources to evaluate anything of a serious or chronic nature.
a2p1U000000RqK7QAK,0011U00000rjeJVQAY,"The staff is friendly and helpful.  Dr. Cook is engaged and helpful, and I am comfortable in his care."
a2p1U000000RsqdQAC,0011U00000rizVjQAI,positive first visit
a2p3g000000KzGGAA0,0011U00000ri2ikQAA,Love your concept. The great downfall has been XYZ's inability to keep doctors on staff. XYZ was very fortunate to be able to contract with Scott Davidson in Pueblo
a2p1U000000Rp4CQAS,0011U00000ri8LTQAY,no
a2p1U000000RseNQAS,0011U00000rhqnNQAQ,"convenient, quick"
a2p1U000000RpWrQAK,0011U00000ribkZQAQ,This is the first time a doctor has spent more than 15 min. with me and he explained medication to me. We set a goal for treatment.
a2p1U000000RoI7QAK,0011U00000rj8XbQAI,Locations are not very convenient. Not enough male doctors.
a2p1U000000RqfRQAS,0011U00000riewPQAQ,"economical, excellent service"
a2p1U000000RsmnQAC,0011U00000rjzgkQAA,"Easy, convenient, good for someone like me that rarely goes to the doctor."
a2p1U000000RplSQAS,0011U00000rj7n7QAA,"I like the location, the convenience, the cost."
a2p1U000000RstDQAS,0011U00000riXJjQAM,I like the availability of the office and the ease of getting an appointment when needed for emergencies.
a2p3g000000KzIcAAK,0011U00000rjkE6QAI,"Great experience, very quick appointment time, excellent people both in reception and in the examination rooms."
a2p1U000000RqOWQA0,0011U00000rjC3DQAU,It has only been one visit - need more experience to refer on
a2p1U000000RtPTQA0,0011U00000riMzrQAE,I really liked the nurse and the doctor and it was pretty fast
a2p1U000000RtTOQA0,0011U00000rjS70QAE,Average service
a2p1U000000RslYQAS,0011U00000rjKq4QAE,I liked the level of attention I received and that every concern was listened to.
a2p1U000000RoBFQA0,0011U00000rjRjVQAU,"The team was friendly, accommodating, and I felt like they cared."
a2p1U000000Rpd4QAC,0011U00000rhyA8QAI,They were very professional
a2p1U000000RqVPQA0,0011U00000rii9pQAA,"I don't usually recommend doctors.  I feel that people have their insurance, and that is how they get a doctor."
a2p1U000000RpRlQAK,0011U00000rj9BYQAY,"Very friendly staff, very convenient and took care of all my needs and then some."
a2p1U000000Ros2QAC,0011U00000riiKDQAY,Relatively fast and smooth check-in; competent nurse & doctor.
a2p1U000000RoALQA0,0011U00000rj03HQAQ,Overall good. you do need a better way to get in when sick. I can never get into a location by me.
a2p1U000000Rp49QAC,0011U00000rja3FQAQ,Very convenient
a2p1U000000RtFTQA0,0011U00000rk5e1QAA,"Easy, friendly, comfortable, no co-pay"
a2p1U000000RppSQAS,0011U00000rjOGqQAM,"The service is very generic and not personable.  It is difficult to get in to see the doctor and when I do, it is a challenge to get my regular prescription filled."
a2p3g000000KzGTAA0,0011U00000rjacAQAQ,"Nice, friendly service and the doctor took his time and answered all my questions."
a2p1U000000RsytQAC,0011U00000rjA5VQAU,Quick and easy
a2p1U000000RpAgQAK,0011U00000riKG3QAM,Convenient and affordable
a2p1U000000RsnLQAS,0011U00000rkAEfQAM,I have seen a number of transitions in service  and staff that have been challenging.
a2p1U000000RoxiQAC,0011U00000rjMUwQAM,It was an average visit. Nice staff and on time.
a2p1U000000RswnQAC,0011U00000rjaICQAY,It took forever to get in to see the doctor.  My appointment was at 2:45 and I didn't get out of the doctors office until 4:10pm.  That is extremely to long for walking across the street to see and online doctor.
a2p3g000000LAgMAAW,0011U00000riuhJQAQ,The doctors can and do give more time to reach patient visit. It seems that the exams are more thorough because the visit is not rushed.
a2p1U000000RqRcQAK,0011U00000riGN8QAM,Too hard of a push to have everything done there and not respect the relationship already built with another primary care physician. Does not seem to remember or document certain things gone over.
a2p1U000000RtLuQAK,0011U00000rhzPdQAI,convenient
a2p1U000000Rp7bQAC,0011U00000riPkKQAU,I like the time my Dr spent with me and the flexibility of appointment times. This is my first visit so I don't have a lot to say yet. except so far so good .
a2p1U000000Rsg2QAC,0011U00000rk6Q3QAI,"Prompt, courteous, thorough,"
a2p1U000000RoadQAC,0011U00000rjTqRQAU,good service
a2p1U000000RoPYQA0,0011U00000riWdaQAE,"I have rolling veins,  I told the nurse and she still was not able to draw my blood after 2 tries.  are you hiring professionals?  this seems like a pretty basic skill for a nurse.  Then she suggested I use Lab Corp - where the lady did not understand the billing procedure.  At an earlier visit I had been told the 2 companies closely work together, so why wouldn't she understand.  after an additional back and forth I left.  No blood draw."
a2p3g000000oeXVAAY,0011U0000125JkCQAU,"I like the concept of XYZ and I like my nurse practitioner, but there are certain things she wonâ€™t treat through telemedicine, such as a UTI, that the Cleveland Clinic telemedicine doctors will treat. Itâ€™s a hassle, especially with young children and Covid."
a2p1U000000Rp6pQAC,0011U00000rkBYPQA2,i was happy with the service I received.
a2p1U000000RqdBQAS,0011U00000rillsQAA,Convienient

a2p1U000000RtEvQAK,0011U00000rjNznQAE,Staff was friendly and conscientious.
a2p1U000000RvbyQAC,0011U00000rk0hMQAQ,Dr. Hester was very friendly and engaged in active listening.  This is a critical skill to a patient.
a2p4w000002O3faAAC,0011U00000rivtvQAA,"I feel I have had great care and that the staff spends time and listens to my concerns.  They are thorough, professional and kind.  I am a little concerned about staffing as my doctor is leaving and I don't know who is next."
a2p1U000000RpL8QAK,0011U00000riuNUQAY,Always able to see a person at any time.
a2p1U000000RqSDQA0,0011U00000rikoLQAQ,the doctor does'nt have a lot of patients so he can spend some time to get to know you
a2p1U000000RsUSQA0,0011U00000riewmQAA,quick no wait
a2p1U000000RpN4QAK,0011U00000rjoKfQAI,Dr. Roberts explains to you why and how.
a2p1U000000l8B9QAI,0011U00000rhuBKQAY,I did not get any benefit from the visit except that wellness point seemed to be the push I got.
a2p1U000000Rq5kQAC,0011U00000rippKQAQ,Everyone is nice and I got in quick but I don't feel like what I was given helped me at all.  Not much time spent with me.
a2p1U000000RqIAQA0,0011U00000riQOzQAM,Dr. Brone is friendly and approachable. She looked through the questionnaire carefully and spent time to understand the history of each issues checked. I feel comfortable talking to Dr. Brone.
a2p1U000000Rp9oQAC,0011U00000ri632QAA,"This was my 1st visit.  A friend talked very highly of XYZ and Dr. Hester.  It didn't feel like I received the same level of service.  The physical I received seemed very INCOMPLETE compared to what I previously received.  Dr. Hester seemed rushed and I felt like questions weren't answered.  I noticed that when I left, she did have another patient in a room waiting for her, so this may be the reason.    I'm willing to give another shot to see if my experience is the norm.  My friend was invited for a ""meet"" the doctor appointment, with the physical scheduled for another.  When I asked if this was how my appointments were going to be, it was ""no"" -- you will come in and meet the doctor when the physical is done.  One concern I have, apparently I can ONLY schedule appointments for Wednesdays and Fridays and during limited hours.  What happens when I suddenly get sick and want to see a doctor?  Do I have to wait several days?    I'm hoping the experience for this 1st appointment is a fluke and future experiences are more positive."
a2p4w000002O4B2AAK,0011U00000rijxFQAQ,"I appreciate that XYZ is able to easily fit me into their schedule, so that I don’t have to wait for weeks and weeks to get an appt. It is also very convenient that they have medication on hand. My NP (Montecalvo) was excellent at listening and making me feel heard. She was also very skilled at suggesting a variety of holistic solutions to address my concerns."
a2p1U000000Roc0QAC,0011U00000rjmSNQAY,I really like the care I receive!
a2p1U000000RpHfQAK,0011U00000ri173QAA,Thorough and friendly service.
a2p1U000000RtUPQA0,0011U00000rjg3yQAA,Office seemed unorganized. First impression of nurse wasn't positive
a2p1U000000RoeAQAS,0011U00000rjOJ9QAM,"Friendly, helpful, staff. Cheerful atmosphere among staff. Doctor takes time to listen. Everything ""in-house"" is ""free."""
a2p1U000000RtP6QAK,0011U00000sgyHpQAI,The doctor was very rude and aggresive in pushing testing that I was not comfortable with.
a2p1U000000Ro9QQAS,0011U00000rjdTgQAI,"It certainly depends on the Doctor.  Currently, Dr. Carter who works for XYZ's Town of Mount Pleasant office is great.  What a refreshing change for us.  So yes, as long as you have doctors like her."
a2p4w000002O3tSAAS,0013g000006temfAAA,"Prompt response, and Layne Cryan is so understanding and compassionate, yet to the point. I appreciate that."

a2p3g000000px0OAAQ,0011U00000ridZTQAY,"always quickly take me in, Stay with you to make sure you get a complete results and answers your questions, If blood work is needed for another Office , they will do it."
a2p1U000000RoayQAC,0011U00000riNoiQAE,Friendly caring atmosphere
a2p1U000000RtRsQAK,0011U00000riKbRQAU,"I feel that the Doctor didn't quite listen. When a patient is trying to explain the pain and how often it occurs, they shouldn't dismiss them and by saying it's common you need to loose weight."
a2p3g000000pwzzAAA,0011U00000riiogQAA,I have always had great experiences at XYZ.
a2p3g000000qE36AAE,0011U00000rj31PQAQ,Have provided all needed services
a2p3g000000qGvUAAU,0011U00000rj9T5QAI,XYZ has been great and they got my daughter and I in quickly for Covid tests and were great with instructions.

a2p1U000000RsvoQAC,0011U00000rjYMkQAM,"I like the more personal relationship with the doctor, the 24/7 access to Dr. Synder if needed, and the close proximity of the office to work."
a2p3g000000qJsLAAU,0011U00000rjtqbQAA,quite a few glitches after the office visit
a2p3g000000qGtxAAE,0013g0000094pvPAAQ,How much time is spent with the doctor is the best part of the model
a2p4w000002JlwpAAC,0011U00000rhxYqQAI,"Professionalism, timely notifications, available"
a2p3g000000q0bTAAQ,0011U00000rjHm4QAE,The office staff and doctors are very nice and very knowledgeable.
a2p1U000000RqTAQA0,0011U00000riBXPQA2,"I think it has been a great service so far except one exception. How come we were given a list of medications that we would get at the clinic for free and now they our no longer available. I lost 3 of my prescriptions. I called Karen Smithy and she wasn't even aware of these medications being terminated. I think if your going to terminate medicines with in the first 9 months of promising them for free you need to let people know. Ifelt this was handled very unprofessional, and all the medicines that were pulled need to be put back in the system."
a2p3g000000q0bxAAA,0013g00000CxYDUAA3,"At first I was excited about joining XYZ, but after learning that the doctor I want to see is no longer going to be at the Monterey clinic, I am disappointed. I chose XYZ largely because I wanted to see her, (after doing some research and looking for a doctor, I liked her) and also because the Monterey clinic is very convenient to my home in Monterey. Now, I learn that she is being moved to Salinas, which is too far for me to drive, and I will not be able to manage the distance with my work schedule and the hours of the clinic. This makes it almost useless for me to be part of this group and I may look elsewhere. I'm disappointed, because I was excited about choosing XYZ health and the Ryan Ranch clinic, along with seeing Dr. Simon there. It was a perfect set up for me. Now not so much."
a2p3g000000KztYAAS,0011U00000rjUDmQAM,At the present my experiences been positive with the interaction and communication.
a2p3g000000KzGpAAK,0011U00000riEk3QAE,Good service in and out
a2p1U000000l8CnQAI,0011U00000riAkkQAE,Everyone is so nice and I love Claudett Jackson. You don't have to wait long when you go in
a2p1U000000RuqYQAS,0011U00000rk2ZyQAI,Fast service
a2p1U000000RtLGQA0,0011U00000rjCJwQAM,Took too much time talking about things not medically related
a2p3g000000KymiAAC,0011U00000rj5XxQAI,quick and friendly service
a2p1U000000Rsn7QAC,0011U00000riEfaQAE,"DR Mchael Noble left. I switched to Concentra for my PCP becuase of dr noble now he is gone. the new dr wont be there for a while. Claudette the NP is nice , i love one of the nurses maugarita , sarah another nurse is nice , but that tracy nurse needs an attitude adjustment"
a2p1U000000RoKhQAK,0011U00000ri1YAQAY,Consulta
a2p1U000000RoczQAC,0011U00000ri9K4QAI,I have been using your services for almost four years. I have seen the organization change and not for the better. I used to encourage my coworkers to choose this health plan because of your amazing services. No more. You don't offer what you used to. Now you're all about profit with little investment in making the office look and feel clean and price gouging your customers.
a2p1U000000l8KpQAI,0011U00000rjRoaQAE,"XYZ has a hard time making appts. after2:30 for there patients. It took 5 day's to get my last appt. which took 5 minutes. She was prompt, took care of the problem immediately and asked if there was anything else she could do for me. Better thana ANY other Dr. I've been to. The only issue I had was the appt. wait time though it is the end of the year."
a2p1U000000RsUOQA0,0011U00000rjI0XQAU,"Convenience.  Dr. Haly is very down to earth and no-nonsense, which I like."
a2p1U000000RsU2QAK,0011U00000rjdThQAI,I would recommend this only if a friend did not have a regular physician.
a2p3g000000oRnSAAU,0013g000003oCBAAA2,More time with doctor.  No copays.  No waiting in the waiting room.
a2p3g000000L02ZAAS,0011U00000rk9c3QAA,"Attentive, courteous care."
a2p1U000000RpD3QAK,0011U00000rj0x6QAA,"No waiting time, for the most part, for appointments"
a2p1U000000Roh7QAC,0011U00000rjdxnQAA,I feel they did a good job
a2p1U000000RqYcQAK,0011U00000ri8hpQAA,"Doctors get to know me and my family on s personal level. Would be slightly reluctant to tell people, for fear of losing that."
a2p1U000000RsqNQAS,0011U00000rjJ9uQAE,"Clean, friendly, gave it a seven because not much of my family lives nearby and not because I was dissatisfied."
a2p1U000000Rp5YQAS,0011U00000rjSxaQAE,Seems to be a little more personal than standard Dr. visits
a2p1U000000RtNdQAK,0011U00000riQ3AQAU,I'm stuck with it
a2p1U000000RqGuQAK,0011U00000ri01rQAA,"Due to my extreme pain, they were able to see me that day."
a2p1U000000RpGtQAK,0011U00000rjaNWQAY,"Good doctor, quick appointments"
a2p4w000002O3dPAAS,0014w000031qkgUAAQ,Pleasant staff
a2p4w000002NyHJAA0,0014w00002pPb3hAAC,They were very kind and listened to my medical concerns during the visit.
a2p4w000002NyLzAAK,0014w00002pPb45AAC,Limited interaction to yet formulate a solid opinion.
a2p4w000002O04gAAC,0011U00000rjLm6QAE,Cant get through to anyone anymore phones go to a voicemail link - you've gotten rid of the front office personnel that we have known for YEARS  - referrals don't go through - person working the front is very pleasant but extremely over worked
a2p4w000002O0P0AAK,0014w000031g0T2AAI,Not enough experience w. them yet
a2p4w000002NyI2AAK,0014w00002pQKcvAAG,Dr Cramer and her staff are the best doctors office I have ever been to.  I recommend they often
a2p4w000002KB6zAAG,0011U00000rjUPIQA2,I have had wonderful care there but I have only see the MD once in 3 years. My nurse practitioner that I see regularly is fantastic!!
a2p4w000002KK5RAAW,0013g00000KUOu1AAH,"Understanding,safe and frien8"
a2p4w000002KHdQAAW,0011U00000rjyWaQAI,The MAs where very friendly and Dr. Lee is a great doctor. My knee has been hurting for over a month and she helped me figure out why.
a2p4w000002O03JAAS,0014w00002pPauxAAC,Friendly and attentive to what needed to be done at my appointment
a2p4w000002NzShAAK,0011U00000riboYQAQ,quick and efficient service
a2p4w000002NyZSAA0,0011U00000rioVPQAY,I'm 80% satisfied with the service.
a2p4w000002NymlAAC,0011U00000rjw4UQAQ,Dr. Pfieffer is knowledgeable and approachable.  It used to be mush easier to get appointments.
a2p4w000002NzjdAAC,0011U00000rjK9iQAE,Doctors are available and engage
a2p4w000002NyvsAAC,0014w00002pPaRNAA0,No one called me for my appointment. I was told to ignore the video call link and they would call my cell phone.  We called several times to be told we were next in line. Then we called and the office was closed. No call.  We left several messages on the urgent number line and no phone call back.
a2p4w000002NzNXAA0,0014w000031qEXlAAM,They were nice and thurorw
a2p4w000002K71RAAS,0011U00000rjhCfQAI,Fast
a2p4w000002O0BSAA0,0014w000031qF6hAAE,Very personal (and personable) service
a2p4w000002K8hTAAS,0011U000011EkqRQAS,Clean and excellent staff and doctor
a2p4w000002Nz8mAAC,0011U00000rix91QAA,I think they really care for their patients and take time with us. I don’t feel that I’m being rushed through an appointment so they can get to the next one.
a2p4w000002NzyJAAS,0013g000006tiLNAAY,Jenny is amazing!
a2p4w000002NylxAAC,0014w00002pQHQYAA4,Staff is exceptional and takes the time to make you feel welcome and not rushed.
a2p4w000002NzoEAAS,0011U00000rhrC4QAI,"Friendly, competent, quick access to a doctor."
a2p4w000002NzdQAAS,0014w000031qEVkAAM,Good and friendly service and I liked the explanation of every question I had.
a2p4w000002KK5bAAG,0011U00000rk2rxQAA,"My doctor is great. The relationship between Anthem and XYZ is a bit confusing, though. I understand that Anthem has an arrangement with XYZ to provide direct primary care, but the fact that my doctor is not listed in the Anthem website creates confusion because it looks as if my primary care physician is not in my insurance plan. Also, within a year of joining XYZ, my doctor was switched to another office. I am waiting to see how frequently doctors move around with XYZ. (The whole point, as I understood it, was to develop to an ongoing relationship with the doctor.) I'm also not thrilled that I get two texts, two emails, and one phone call just to remind me that I have an upcoming appointment.)"
a2p1U000000RpRwQAK,0011U00000rjFpkQAE,My doctor is extremely personable and has made it extremely convenient and easy to get in touch in case of a medical emergency.
a2p1U000000RpxqQAC,0011U00000rjuWVQAY,Quick registration
a2p1U000000RppsQAC,0011U00000rjAOnQAM,Friendly staff
a2p3g000000oeW1AAI,0011U00000rhvSuQAI,Arvada clinic personnel are friendly and profesional
a2p1U000000RoGaQAK,0011U00000rk2JHQAY,"Convenient, quick, thorough."
a2p3g000000owPeAAI,0011U00000rinetQAA,"Did not feel as comfortable w/ staff there, as I did w/ the previous staff. I really like Sr. Franz,  but unfortunately was not able to see her this time.   If was strange that the assistant did a blood draw on me without wearing gloves."
a2p3g000000owM7AAI,0011U00000rjeIHQAY,They donâ€™t follow up on tests.   I always have to call and ask for results.
a2p3g000000pU68AAE,0011U00000rk3WOQAY,The visit went well. Dr Franz took time to answer questions. Easy to talk to. Mandy did a great job too.
a2p3g000000oRZyAAM,0011U00000riMrHQAU,Phone consults are easier than going to Beachwood
a2p4w000002NypkAAC,0011U00000rk800QAA,Staff is friendly and knowledgeable
a2p3g000000pjmYAAQ,0013g000002vOa8AAE,"My appointment was a follow up for depression meds.  Once that was done, I shared I'd had a 102 temp and body aches.  I was told to get tested for covid, but no follow up was planned.  I continue to test negative for covid."
a2p1U000000l8E4QAI,0011U00000ri6ABQAY,My Doctor spent more time than my previous PCP would and did not seem rushed.  He listened to my concerns and although he did not have the answers he did mention that he knew a specialist and would reach out to find an answer.
a2p1U000000RqVaQAK,0011U00000rjFvEQAU,My friends don't have access. I would recommend to my coworkers
a2p1U000000Rt1BQAS,0011U00000ribPSQAY,"Convenience, quality time with doc,"
a2p1U000000RtSHQA0,0011U00000riJ45QAE,Great service
a2p1U000000RppQQAS,0011U00000rjQadQAE,"Staffvis great, but the hours could be more for people who work."
a2p1U000000RolVQAS,0011U00000riXM6QAM,Quick prompt callbacks and excellent service.
a2p3g000000owP0AAI,0011U00000rk9zsQAA,Dr Kelly takes the time to listen and does not have the hurried approach that many drâ€™s take
a2p4w000002NzsGAAS,0011U00000rjUlPQAU,The nurse was not able to draw my blood. She seemed very unsure and inexperienced. She asked if I wanted to try again or if I wanted to go go somewhere else. I didn’t feel comfortable letting her try again.
a2p4w000002O1AQAA0,0014w00002pQEsoAAG,Waited a hour past my appointment time to see the doctor
a2p4w000002O0yyAAC,0013g000009gjRsAAI,Easy to schedule.  Convenient.
a2p4w000002O0sHAAS,0011U00000ricFqQAI,It took longer than anticipated to get an appointment. Then the day before the appointment I was informed it would be a telehealth visit. I booked the appointment for the purpose of a physical exam since I wasn't feeling well. Policies around no in-person visits if you  have COVID-like systems needs to be clearly stated before booking an appointment. I do not have COVID and just needed to see a doctor. Will go to urgent care next time and not bother with XYZ. The physician was nice and as helpful as she could be over the phone.
a2p4w000002O0qzAAC,0014w00002pQFIeAAO,Nice
a2p4w000002O0eKAAS,0014w00002pPiLgAAK,First time being there but if they were gonna gets be for covid they still could have given me some antibiotics or something just in case it wasn’t so that I don’t have to go two more days feeling bad because if it is covid than the antibiotic just wouldn’t do anything. Just don’t see why you would have to go two more days of feeling like crap because “everything has to be covid no days”
a2p4w000002O34yAAC,0011U00000rhx14QAA,My Dr. takes the time to know me and explains any new prescriptions that he may prescribe. He understands what my health issues are and is willing to refer me to a specialist if needed.
a2p4w000002O0pmAAC,0011U00000rjqabQAA,"Friendly staff, clean facility."
a2p4w000002O2ktAAC,0014w000031qLZzAAM,I thought the doctor did a great job and the staff was very very polite
a2p4w000002NztnAAC,0011U00000zRVIzQAO,"I loved my previous provider, Jenna Becker, at XYZ Health. I also like the idea of XYZ Health as a whole. However, I would not recommend the particular PA that I saw yesterday. I will not see her again. I will actually suggest to my colleagues that they go elsewhere. Her bedside manner was very poor. It was the first time I left a medical appointment feeling put down, not listened to, and defeated. I actually sat in my car and cried because of how I felt when I left my appointment, which is out of character for me. I would like to say that Georgia, the assistant, was very pleasant and helpful (e.g., assisting in setting up an appt for a mammogram, listening to my concerns and medical needs in the initial interview before I saw the PA)."
a2p4w000002O0m4AAC,0014w000031g26MAAQ,"People were very helpful, professional and nice."
a2p4w000002Nz1qAAC,0014w000031g0jgAAA,Save money
a2p4w000002O3KmAAK,0011U00000ril7dQAA,I would of rated higher for this question. However yesterday at my appointment I learned my favorite dr....Dr Guerzon was leaving XYZ. She was part of my reason being a patient at XYZ.  Dr Guerzon was always professional.  She showed care and concerned while being under her care
a2p4w000002O1IFAA0,0014w000031qxAkAAI,Prompt and professional
a2p4w000002O0RaAAK,0014w000031qbokAAA,staff is friendly; quick to give me a call back and get the appt scheduled
a2p4w000002O4XSAA0,0014w000031qbEfAAI,We go to XYZ with our work program. It's nice and convenient.
a2p4w000002O0AtAAK,0011U00000rjMiRQAU,Better than the huge medical practices.
a2p4w000002O0ytAAC,0014w00002pPat5AAC,Dr. didnt seem to take the information I provided into account. Puts me on quarantine after testing negative for covid seems ridiculous waste of time which i cannot afford to waste.
a2p4w000002O0yFAAS,0011U00000riGJRQA2,Always have appts available and the staff is very nice.
a2p4w000002O1IPAA0,0014w00002pPatqAAC,You make it hard to get a hold of the clinic. Tried 3 times before I got a hold of a live person.
a2p4w000002Nzt4AAC,0014w000031qLhAAAU,I dont refer anybody to a healthcare provider.
a2p4w000002O0ERAA0,0011U00000rkBNTQA2,Amy & Courtney (nurses) were fabulous!
a2p4w000002O0n2AAC,0011U00000rjEj6QAE,Location and availability
a2p1U000000Rss3QAC,0011U00000rjGqhQAE,Courteous service and convenient location
a2p1U000000RsbLQAS,0011U00000rj5mIQAQ,I learned that I did not have a spider in my ear but other than that there was nothing done. I don't know why I am having the issues I have been having and they are new. No test were done. What I was told could be the problem I had already read on the internet.
a2p1U000000RsTwQAK,0011U00000rjfkoQAA,Had to wait awhile.  Not enough privacy.  Can hear everything being said to other patients.
a2p1U000000RsQlQAK,0011U00000rinNPQAY,It was a pleasant experieance from time i arrived to the time i left.
a2p1U000000RvaHQAS,0011U00000rjgebQAA,good service. convenient
a2p3g000000LAb0AAG,0011U00000ri1nsQAA,I like the care they provide
a2p1U000000RqHbQAK,0011U00000rj0sqQAA,Wasn't happy with the service I received from Dr. Giles
a2p1U000000RsZUQA0,0011U00000rj8TWQAY,"No problems, nothing outstanding on a first visit."
a2p4w000002O3iPAAS,0011U00000rjx2HQAQ,We sold on how convenient it was.  Easy access.   Love Brittany but North Canton office seems overwhelmed.  Other offices answer phone quickly and appointments faster.  By time they git to get antibody treatment luckily my symptoms are gone so probably don't need it.  Good people there just not enough
a2p1U000000RpApQAK,0011U00000rjax2QAA,"efficient, but the doctor seemed to chit chat a lot"
a2p1U000000RtF9QAK,0011U00000rk47LQAQ,"Great, personal service. Many appointment openings. Attentive doctor. Convenience."
a2p1U000000RoiKQAS,0011U00000rjRokQAE,Good service
a2p1U000000RphMQAS,0011U00000rjHlhQAE,Service is good  but need more flexible hours. Unfortunately have to take time off work in order to visit the doctor.
a2p1U000000RtDuQAK,0011U00000ritR7QAI,Both docs are good and straight forward. They talk in terms patients understand.
a2p4w000002O4X3AAK,0014w000031qOMGAA2,Very informative!
a2p1U000000RpsWQAS,0011U00000rjUmhQAE,Feels like the employees are over whelmed
a2p1U000000Rsp5QAC,0011U00000ri3K8QAI,"I went in for a blood draw, and was to receive a phone call with the results last week as I am traveling this week in Mexico.  Never heard from Dr. Izzard."
a2p1U000000RqHXQA0,0011U00000ri5LaQAI,"convenience, palatable atmosphere, friendly people"
a2p1U000000Rt6wQAC,0011U00000rj7eGQAQ,"Very long appointment (60 min), but not thorough. We didn't go through my medical history and I did not have a women's exam (breast exam, IUD check, etc.)"
a2p1U000000RqIpQAK,0011U00000rjnyiQAA,no current dr no hours after work and made mistakes on my appointment 2 times showed up and they were not there and scheduled me for wrong clinic
a2p1U000000RoIcQAK,0011U00000ricINQAY,When arriving for appointments with my infant I usually am waiting for 20-30 minutes past appointment time to see doctor. Same day appointments are hard to get for urgent matters. I have had to call doctor after hours before for infant medical issues and call back usually take 45 minutes to an hour which is understandable but the tone of doctor seems like I'm bugging her. When my doctor is out of town for a week we receive no notice of this taking place and then we find out no replacement will be at our facility that whole week.
a2p3g000000owN2AAI,0011U00000riAl2QAE,Good service
a2p1U000000RpqDQAS,0011U00000rjGTxQAM,More time with doctor
a2p1U000000RqNNQA0,0011U00000riFIoQAM,"i use paadina health because it is offered at my workplace.  My wife uses it also.  I can't recommend XYZ for friends, because they need to be employed by my employer."
a2p1U000000Rq1lQAC,0011U00000riny6QAA,I love XYZ.  The only issues I have is when I try to schedule an appointment at the location closest to me when I am sick that particular location is not always open.  Sometimes the Doctor is at another location.  And I thought I signed up for this plan due to convenience.  Not always that convenient if I would have to drive 10 miles out of my way for an apt when I am sick.
a2p1U000000RtL7QAK,0011U00000riny6QAA,"When I am sick I want to see my doctor as soon as possible.  I was told that I couldn't even go to my regular office on a specific day because they were working at another location only for another specific company and I could go their, either.  The next closest location was too far away to drive while I'm sick so I had to wait an extra day to get in and miss more work.  Not very convenient."
a2p1U000000Rv8rQAC,0011U00000riOYOQA2,I like the business model and the staff was really nice!
a2p3g000000L0SPAA0,0013g000004DS6nAAG,Their prompt and courteous.
a2p3g000000oeWqAAI,0011U00000rjPH8QAM,"Normally, the quick in-person appointments and longer sessions make for a far superior patient experience. Covid is limiting Both of these for now, but I hope weâ€™re back to normal sometime next year (and that corporate suits donâ€™t mess with this business model in the meantime)."
a2p1U000000RoDIQA0,0011U00000rjjKUQAY,Quick process.
a2p1U000000Rv9VQAS,0011U00000rjesHQAQ,I like the facility and the doctor.  I felt comfortable and felt like the doctor took time with me.
a2p1U000000RtTqQAK,0011U00000ripDmQAI,Easy to get appointments
a2p1U000000RqTQQA0,0011U00000riXLxQAM,"I got in very quickly, the dr was thorough.  He answered all my questions."
a2p1U000000RoyhQAC,0011U00000rjw79QAA,The service was good and I had the doctors full attention.
a2p1U000000RqfxQAC,0011U00000rjQYYQA2,The doctors take their time with me and explain in full detail my options for treatment.
a2p1U000000Rt7AQAS,0011U00000rjlz2QAA,It is a wonderful benefit because most appointments are at no cost and the location is convenient at our DaVita office.
a2p1U000000RvbeQAC,0011U00000rjSbgQAE,Location is right where I work.
a2p1U000000RsgrQAC,0011U00000ri2ikQAA,"My experience was positive, but it was my first. I couldn't make a recommendation based upon a single appt."
a2p1U000000RpmsQAC,0011U00000rjac4QAA,Very nice Doctors and Medical Assistants. Also seem to be quite professional.
a2p1U000000RtLaQAK,0011U00000rjvUhQAI,I usually don't recommend places to people other than immediate family.
a2p1U000000RsvlQAC,0011U00000rjlBEQAY,"excellent one on one conversation doctor, unhurried and detailed exchange."
a2p1U000000RpwYQAS,0011U00000rj1USQAY,Mixed emotions on this. Really felt comfortable with Dr. Marren Weber and now she is no longer there. I'm not the only one upset about this. Most of my co workers that were patients of Dr. Weber are not happy about this.
a2p1U000000RozHQAS,0011U00000ri1Y2QAI,First visit was fine.
a2p1U000000RoFtQAK,0011U00000rjjKQQAY,"It was a good experience. I felt considered, valued and respected."
a2p1U000000RsjwQAC,0011U00000riXwyQAE,"There was an easy feel to the office, the receptionist was friendly, the discussion with the doctor and the follow up discussions were scheduled and timely, the flabotamist was an expert"
a2p1U000000RoZlQAK,0011U00000ripUBQAY,"The clinics are hit and miss.  I received excellent care from Dr. Masterson at the Broomfield, CO clinic however the Arvada, CO clinic I would not recommend to anyone."
a2p1U000000RoQmQAK,0011U00000rk8ACQAY,I like the service this program program provides
a2p1U000000RsxhQAC,0011U00000ridpxQAA,"I used the telemedicine service in the Humana Tower for ear pain. I was told that I likely had a virus and it would resolve on its own. My ear pain continued for another 6 days and went to another clinic, was diagnosed with an ear infection. I did not feel that I was diagnosed appropriately initially and wound up being in pain and ill much longer than I really needed to be."
a2p1U000000RsSNQA0,0011U00000riJdSQAU,"The time professional, friendly, service the extra step Brenda at front desk to get me to the building waiting outside so I could locate the office her calmness and patience. I felt like I mattered I didnt feel rushed. I felt comfortable in the office waiting area and with doctor it was pleasant, personal and laid back. Excellent"
a2p1U000000Rpp7QAC,0011U00000riNCfQAM,Efficient. Accommodating.
a2p1U000000RtQcQAK,0011U00000rizTdQAI,"I like Dr. Ritter and  Laura,  very helpful"

a2p1U000000RseMQAS,0011U00000rjUDwQAM,"Timely attention, thorough appointment, fully satisfied."
a2p1U000000RsSDQA0,0011U00000rj2QQQAY,I like the friendly individual attention and cozy environment
a2p3g000000L1PDAA0,0011U00000rizVjQAI,staff are responsive to patient needs

a2p1U000000Rsi1QAC,0011U00000ri9jSQAQ,Only had one visit. Not sure how most visits will be.
a2p1U000000Rp90QAC,0011U00000ribPbQAI,"Close, good  service, for state employees there's a good discount"
a2p3g000000Kys3AAC,0011U00000rjoMeQAI,Quick and easy.  Dr's are available and very timely appointments

a2p1U000000RpYAQA0,0011U00000riR0KQAU,"It was just my first visit,  seemed good so far"
a2p1U000000Rp69QAC,0011U00000rjX7IQAU,"The appointment was supposed to be a new patient physical.  They called the day of to say the doctor had a meeting and could I come in earlier.  I came in one hour earlier.  To complicate matters they asked if a med student could come it, which I said fine.  He took most of the time up and then when the doctor came in she was visibly in a hurry. I will give XYZ one more chance since my wife has had good experiences with it in Denver."
a2p1U000000RoSiQAK,0011U00000rhyCkQAI,"It was a great experience - I loved not feeling rushed, and really appreciated the feeling that the doctor was happy to stay with me as long as I liked.  I got all my questions answered."
a2p1U000000RskVQAS,0011U00000ri8cnQAA,"I like the convenience of the location, however I've been having real challenges getting some of the referrals, even after recalling for several months (since August).  They end up being forgotten or dropped completely.  Also, Dr Giles told me to stop doing what Dr Cook told me to do- that doesn't seem very professional to me!"
a2p1U000000RvBcQAK,0011U00000rixQmQAI,Conveniently located and friendly knowledgeable staff.
a2p1U000000RsTjQAK,0011U00000riWj0QAE,very happy with the doctor
a2p1U000000RvImQAK,0011U00000rjtibQAA,"From the front desk to the nurse to the exam room with the certified physician, I was attended to thoroughly and thoughtfully."
a2p3g000000oRfSAAU,0011U00000rjLUOQA2,"The PA was defensive when I had to describe to her twice what my previous treatment for a similar infection had been.  I had also confirmed my RX location with the admin in the morning, who was very friendly BTW, and then when the PA ordered the prescription in ended up on an the entirely opposite side of the Denver metro. area."
a2p4w000002KKidAAG,0011U00000rjR8fQAE,Dr. Masterson took time to talk to me about concerns and answered questions and made recommendations on addressing concerns.
a2p4w000002NykaAAC,0011U00000ri6lNQAQ,Dr. Guerzon and Diana are so warm and personable.
a2p4w000002O2AIAA0,0014w00002pQKoDAAW,You can receive great care and service for your health needs

a2p4w000002O1BdAAK,0011U00000riWhTQAU,I've received prompt and professional medical care.
a2p4w000002KKR8AAO,0011U00000rjLSvQAM,"Staff was thorough and pleasant to work with. The nurse at the site was especially great. The visit took longer than expected, but that seemed to be due to making sure everything was thoroughly covered."
a2p4w000002O1p9AAC,0014w00002pPb0LAAS,Don't normally recommend doctors to others
a2p4w000002KKssAAG,0011U00000rikFuQAI,haven't had any problems so I don't visit much
a2p4w000002O1XjAAK,0013g000006tfXVAAY,I like Geni very much.
a2p4w000002KKp0AAG,0011U00000rijPnQAI,I like that I have no copay but I wish there was more availability.
a2p4w000002O38lAAC,0014w00002pQLuYAAW,Girl in front needs more help or training repeated my self numerous times. She was everywhere answering phones trying to do data make appts etc.
a2p4w000002O1MqAAK,0011U00000riqkTQAQ,Ease of scheduling within a day or so.
a2p4w000002KKAgAAO,0011U00000riy7kQAA,I like the individualized care I receive and the fact that it's super convenient having the office onsite where I work.  The office and providers have always made me feel welcome.
a2p4w000002O39yAAC,0011U00000rjIcaQAE,XYZ is only for APS employees from my understanding.
a2p4w000002KIs2AAG,0011U00000rixQmQAI,"Easy scheduling, small clinics, and personable staff."
a2p4w000002O1yzAAC,0014w00002pQBKQAA4,10 am apt waited until 1056am to be seen
a2p4w000002O1irAAC,0014w00002pPaxKAAS,I don't know all services yet as they are new with out company. But so far so good!
a2p4w000002O2WmAAK,0011U00000rjF4qQAE,My husband joined a number of years before I did. It’s nice to have a regular place to go and continuity of care. However you are  sort of at the mercy of the doctors that are hired by ever side versus the broader choice if you picked your own.
a2p4w000002KK8LAAW,0014w00002pPaRKAA0,Everyone I talked with was extremely helpful and accommodating!
a2p4w000002O1jaAAC,0014w00002pQEPlAAO,Sometimes the female staff can be a bit rude when speaking with patients.  Today wasn't as bad a previous experiences but there's still plenty of room for improvement.
a2p4w000002O1t1AAC,0014w00002pQM0UAAW,Very thorough
a2p3g000000Kyv1AAC,0011U00000riCFWQA2,Pt care is good
a2p1U000000RtHNQA0,0011U00000rjUPjQAM,My experience with XYZ is highly dependent upon my experience with their employees. I feel my doctor is spread a bit too thin.
a2p1U000000RsVAQA0,0011U00000rjLm6QAE,Too hard to get - no parking available - limited doctor availability
a2p3g000000oeXaAAI,0011U00000riFIXQA2,Personal expereince
a2p1U000000RoyQQAS,0011U00000rjpByQAI,They were fast and efficient but slightly impersonal.
a2p1U000000RosyQAC,0011U00000riJ3aQAE,"I'm very new to it, so I would like to get a better feel for it before recommending.  so far, so good."
a2p1U000000RvCZQA0,0011U00000rj2SyQAI,The doctor I seen was worthless I had to ask her to at least look in my ears.  The hours were not very convenient.
a2p1U000000RtCMQA0,0011U00000riWj6QAE,It convenient and I love my love doctor
a2p1U000000RvMyQAK,0011U00000riBtQQAU,You did not seem interested in helping me be as healthy as possible.
a2p1U000000RoU3QAK,0011U00000rippKQAQ,I saw Dr King for the 1st time and she was AMAZING!!  She really listened and I would go back to HER only!
a2p1U000000Rqa6QAC,0011U00000rippBQAQ,"Convenient for mild illness-cold, eye infection, etc. Would stick with primary care or specialized doctor for other things."
a2p3g000000Kzt0AAC,0011U000019xyjdQAA,Very easy to schedule an appointment and was able to be seen immediately.
a2p1U000000RtKaQAK,0011U00000rk2bCQAQ,Friendly customer service.  Dr. was easy to talk with during my visit.
a2p1U000000RqXQQA0,0011U00000rjUYNQA2,Only works if you are part of their employer network.  (eg. Employed by DVA or one of their customers). REtail membership is expensive.
a2p1U000000Ro5yQAC,0011U00000rillTQAQ,convenient friendly
a2p1U000000RsqSQAS,0011U00000riTrtQAE,Easy access to health care and doctor
a2p1U000000RssEQAS,0011U00000rj6d6QAA,I was in the office for almost 3 hours for my visit.
a2p3g000000KzLnAAK,0011U00000rjUmhQAE,Good service and good people

a2p4w000002O3YoAAK,0014w00002pQO1YAAW,Appointment went well enough
a2p4w000002O3iFAAS,0014w000031qZveAAE,Fasted all night for labs. Showed up on time and was informed they couldn’t draw blood because they were out of supplies.
a2p3g000000L1OyAAK,0011U00000rk6cyQAA,"In my past experience with XYZ, it seems very unorganized with the front desk staff. I have been told that prescriptions would be called in and I have to call back because they were not. I was told yesterday that my order for a UA at LabCorp would be sent in an hour. I could attend either LabCorp that was in my town. I went to one LabCorp and they did not have the order. I called the provider and was told that they were get back to me in an hour. It has been an hour and a half. Visiting one office- the doctor and front desk staff were discussing political opinions. This did not seem very professional to me."
a2p1U000000RqagQAC,0011U00000rhpzJQAQ,"Timely, informative, got what I needed with little that I didn't"
a2p1U000000RtSEQA0,0011U00000rjkbKQAQ,Great staff. Very friendly and sincere
a2p1U000000RtB7QAK,0011U00000riUpWQAU,service is a little slow

a2p1U000000RqHcQAK,0011U00000riO5gQAE,"Convenient, friendly and professional"
a2p1U000000RpZMQA0,0011U00000ri9eZQAQ,I thought that the ARNP was very nice & caring. I did not have to wait long at all before being seen which is typical in a regular PCP office. The only reason I give it an 8 is because I think it would be better if you accepted walk ins.
a2p1U000000RsRkQAK,0011U00000rir0VQAQ,Nice Dr. and staff. Not so busy that I am just a random patient.
a2p3g000000KzDLAA0,0011U00000rk0ogQAA,It was clean  The doctor & recipients was friendly
a2p1U000000Rob4QAC,0011U00000rj9FoQAI,"Swift, friendly, convenient"

a2p1U000000RtO5QAK,0011U00000riSTtQAM,I have had good visits to the clinic in federal way but my wife has been in to the Tacoma and Puyallup ones and have been told diagnoses that didn't end up being the issue.
a2p1U000000RtB9QAK,0011U00000rjJceQAE,it has been several days they said what I have will pass I am so congested I cant sleept at nite i am calling my cpc for a perscription
a2p1U000000Rp0hQAC,0011U00000ri8caQAA,Friendly and took detailed information. Didn't try to push things on me I didn't need.
a2p1U000000Rsi3QAC,0011U00000rjeK6QAI,Quick over the phone referral for follow up MRI.
a2p1U000000RupQQAS,0011U00000ri5E4QAI,i like dr miller and location
a2p1U000000RsmrQAC,0011U00000riNCfQAM,"friendly; didn't feel """"oversold"""""
a2p1U000000RpW1QAK,0011U00000rjOJ9QAM,"Free for anything """"in-house"""" Good service Personable doctors"

a2p1U000000l8BXQAY,0011U00000rjZedQAE,It was super easy.

a2p4w000002O4NIAA0,0014w000031qLZzAAM,Very nice
a2p4w000002O41RAAS,0011U00000riQ2cQAE,I was given very poor instructions and poor service.
a2p3g000000oeXHAAY,0013g000007ZWV9AAO,"Pros: Convenient; easy to schedule an appointment in the near future and at my convenience.  Cons: unable to schedule a video appointment because ""my system could not support"" such an appointment. I tried a laptop (Mac), desktop (Mac), iPhone X and was unsuccessful."
a2p1U000000RqZvQAK,0011U00000rjKDkQAM,Super easy to get in! One hour appointment is probably too long though. Shoot for 30 min.
a2p1U000000RtN5QAK,0011U00000rjf9NQAQ,"convenience, as part of UCAR health coverage"
a2p1U000000RsiVQAS,0011U00000rk74kQAA,"I had a good experience on my first visit, and feel it is worth giving XYZ a try."
a2p4w000002O3cMAAS,0014w000031s30xAAA,Convenience
a2p1U000000RogmQAC,0011U00000ri6ouQAA,I love the ability to get a doctor's appointment with someone I know and trust on short notice.  I am home from DC visiting my family and I had a health crisis that was not something the emergency room could deal with very well.  Dr. Malfese was able to see me immediately and was able to get me the care I needed.
a2p1U000000Rt8gQAC,0011U00000rjhh8QAA,I do not have back blood test results yet. Otherwise the service was excellent.
a2p1U000000RqZnQAK,0011U00000ricIZQAY,"Accessibility to doctors, flexibility with appointments."
a2p3g000000KzCzAAK,0011U00000ri4qRQAQ,My appointment was on time. The staff is very polite and respectful. My doctor is a good listener who gave me her full attention.
a2p1U000000RsTxQAK,0011U00000riAl1QAE,good one on one time with the Dr.
a2p1U000000RoAwQAK,0011U00000sgxbcQAA,Always timely so I don't have to wait. The practioner and doctor are both thorough.
a2p1U000000RsafQAC,0011U00000rk52KQAQ,The attention that they put into me personally and the care I receive is phenomenal.
a2p1U000000RvgkQAC,0011U00000riqkTQAQ,Works for me. I don't know if it's a good fit for everyone.
a2p3g000000oRj0AAE,0011U00000rjKcyQAE,Services is 24/7

a2p1U000000Rt1xQAC,0011U00000rj3x3QAA,Very nice demeanor by everyone and very conscientious when evaluating symptoms. I feel that Dr. McCay and all Nursing staff are very thorough.
a2p1U000000RoUfQAK,0011U00000rjNt4QAE,"convenient, efficient, thorough"
a2p1U000000Rp6GQAS,0011U00000rjesaQAA,It depends on the kind of medical attention that is needed.
a2p1U000000Rt93QAC,0011U00000riwZHQAY,Free appt. and some meds and Dr. Glaser takes the time to talk about your health.
a2p1U000000RtI5QAK,0011U00000rjyaPQAQ,"great coverage, good doctors"
a2p1U000000RqCTQA0,0011U00000rjdTgQAI,"I was not aware of XYZ Health until the Town of Mount Pleasant contracted you to be our Doctors.  I, currently am very pleased with my Doctor, Cici Carter.  To my knowledge, you can't just choose XYZ as your health care provider."
a2p1U000000RqMAQA0,0011U00000rjt7NQAQ,I've had some balls dropped with them. They have new staff now so hopefully it won't happen again but I love Dr. Glaser.
a2p1U000000RpSYQA0,0011U00000riYejQAE,Good people very nice. Not pushy.
a2p4w000002O3emAAC,0014w000031qdNrAAI,I called regarding refill…. Had to call five days later cause I got no feedback… then I get a call Friday at 7:30 six days later ….. schedule appointment sat for an hour for a routine physical…. Then was told it takes long to set room up … the  woman behind the desk had blood drawn and urine test in 20 min and 40 sitting ….. Tammy saw he six times and didn’t even say sorry I’m running late super unprofessional!!! I missed an hour of work and was late getting my daughter cause if this….. I have no desire to come back…. Then she calls saying she can do the rest of the physical over the phone. How disappointing
a2p1U000000RsUsQAK,0011U00000sgxUHQAY,"I liked many parts of the visit such as the nursing staff, location, efficiency but would have reservations in recommending because I did not care for the doctor that I saw during my annual. My most recent visit was for a flu shot which went very well."
a2p3g000000LAf5AAG,0011U00000riY1cQAE,"It is convenient to get lab work on site and have all my prescriptions filled.  But I'm on my 4th doctor in 4 years, so continuity of care is lacking."
a2p1U000000RprHQAS,0011U00000rjPLeQAM,"XYZ Health can be very convenient, but it hasn't been as convenient as I hoped or thought it would be due to doctor turnovers and office closures."
a2p4w000002O2pAAAS,0014w000031g0yNAAQ,You are receiving a 6 because i feel u are genuine in caring for my health but it just takes way way way too long. I sat in a room for 40 minutes waiting on 3 bottles of pills. You need to be way faster. Remember most of us are going to see you during work hours and are then chastised for it taking so long . I will give it 1 more chance before I go back to paying my primary physician.  Yall got to be faster!
a2p4w000002O32iAAC,0014w000031qAI9AAM,"Milton is great, listens well and explains things well.   Very helpful staff."
a2p4w000002O3aQAAS,0011U00000rjM32QAE,You cannot beat the convenience and service.  And the staff is always friendly.
a2p1U000000RpuAQAS,0011U00000riCSHQA2,Don't care
a2p3g000000KynlAAC,0011U00000rk5L7QAI,"Well, I get it free through work and they're super convenient, and that's great, but Idk that it's better than anyone else out there.  Except Aurora, anyone is better than Aurora"
a2p4w000002O2QyAAK,0014w000031qjrRAAQ,Caring staff
a2p1U000000RoKUQA0,0011U00000rjnPZQAY,This is the second time I'm doing this review.  First one was before I went to get an X-ray that the doctor was supposed to send orders in for 6 days ago.  X-ray lab never received them. I called the office and a rather rude girl told me she would send them right away. 30 minutes later still no orders. I called a second time and they told me they couldn't find the orders. And it's bexause they were so busy that day. It's been 6 days since I saw the doctor so busy today doesn't really apply.
a2p1U000000RqYYQA0,0011U00000rih7mQAA,"Quick appointments, great care, affordable"
a2p1U000000RozZQAS,0011U00000rj5Y3QAI,Felt comfortable and was listened to instead of rushed thru  for next patient
a2p4w000002NzvtAAC,0011U00000ri4DnQAI,good feedback from Dr.
a2p4w000002O2eqAAC,0011U00000rk2JFQAY,"It is easier, very little waiting, no payment due, and good service."
a2p4w000002O2diAAC,0011U00000rk9wtQAA,I was happy that I got a response as I did.
a2p1U000000RsT7QAK,0011U00000rhrv5QAA,Service is great.  Dr Cameron is thorough and looks out for my money
a2p1U000000Rp6LQAS,0011U00000rjj5tQAA,My initial blood results never went through for the biometric screening.
a2p3g000000LAaQAAW,0011U00000rjnAYQAY,Dr Masterson very nice and helpful.
a2p3g000000Kyp4AAC,0011U00000rjTU0QAM,"Treated like a human and,that she cares."
a2p1U000000Rva3QAC,0011U00000riaSsQAI,I have had a great experience working with my doctor to get my health better a work in progress
a2p1U000000RsZzQAK,0011U00000rjhGLQAY,The doctor was knowledgeable and thorough but I couldn't help wonder that the Dr. is required to try cheaper therapies first to keep costs down.
a2p1U000000RpB9QAK,0011U00000riXbDQAU,Everything that was done was free for one. The other thing was that me and my kids where the only ones there for the afternoon. That means we had the staffs attention all to our self.  Was able to ask all the questions that I wanted and not feel rushed.
a2p1U000000Rt4HQAS,0011U00000rjt7CQAQ,"The nurses were great but the doctor seemed more interested in talking than listening. He seemed very interested in promoting himself & his services rather than being a healthcare teammate on MY team. When I visited previously there was a temporary doctor, Dr. Udin (possibly Odin) I believe, who was hands-down fantastic. He listened to 'my' story and asked relevant questions rather than making assumptions out loud the way Dr. McCay did. Other than the doctor, I was also set back by things out of my control. For example, somehow the doctors office had 9 patient profiles for me; none of them with my correct info. Because of this I had a terrible time getting access to the online portal and viewing lab results. I was told the info was sent over from Humana, which is fine, but there should have been a printout or something to look over & verify the info was correct. This delay was completely avoidable. Overall, I would not recommend friend/family to visit this office, as I am not someone who is uneducated looking for a doctor to boss me around. Instead, I have worked in healthcare over 10+ years and appreciate when a physician is knowledgeable to current healthcare practices and research rather than an outdated view. This is something I've seen not just in this office but in many offices with older, white, American doctors. I do not feel they are properly trained in common-sense things, such as the benefits of a vegetarian diet. One mention of my diet and Dr. McCay stated it would be insufficient for pregnancy or otherwise due to low protein/Vit B. As demonstrated by my labs this was not at all true for me, as all labs were in normal range. It is assumptions like this that cause me to question anything the doctor says, as I find myself wondering if he is really up-to-date in his knowledge. Specifically, on this issue, it was as if the doctor had no idea millions of people around the world have vegetarian diets and have had such for centuries."
a2p1U000000RurJQAS,0011U00000rjgpxQAA,I am a new member but so far it seems to be ok.
a2p3g000000oeUuAAI,0011U000019xyemQAA,"First - very unprofessional that at the front desk there is a stuffed pile of ""poo"" on top of a file cabinet.  Second girl that measure my height was completely off.  Third girl taking blood never showed me the label with my name to confirm it was me.  Fourth after my blood was in the vial, girl tossed vial to the counter.  Have never experienced this anywhere else."
a2p1U000000RogAQAS,0011U00000rjLDfQAM,"Dr. Wang was one of the rudest physicians I have ever met. From the start of the appointment he practically interrogated me on my current prescription. He made it clear through his questions that he did not believe that I actually have a psychological disorder, even though it was in my medical records that I have had the diagnosis and prescription since I was a child. Medical records, by the way, which he never asked for. He also repeatedly asked me questions about drug abuse and selling drugs like he thought I was some common criminal. I understand that many of these questions may be legally required but the fact that he would ask them multiple times like he was trying to catch me (when I haven't done anything wrong) was very offensive. In addition, because I work out he implied that I might be taking testosterone or growth hormone. He also had-mouthed my previous physician saying he's going to get locked up by the DEA because of the scripts he was writing me. On that note, that won't happen because my previous physician would not have been able to get those scripts filled by the company Express Scripts if they violated any laws. That is a very large pharmaceutical company and they are very strict about those things.  Overall, this was the worst experience I've ever had with any kind of doctor. He was rude, offensive, and rambled a lot with no clear direction or purpose. I would not recommend Dr. Wang to ANYONE."
a2p1U000000Rt2EQAS,0011U00000ri8d7QAA,I have a history of Depression in myself as well as my family.  My brother committed suicide and my sister was hospitalized.  The help I received was a non script of over the counter meds.  I am really having a hard time dealing and even taking those am very upset all the time.  I feel that I am still in jeopardy.  I do not feel that she listened to the history or took it into consideration.  I have an apt with my Primary in Dec.  I was not able to get into see her before then.  I know I am on the edge with my stress and depression.  This is why I came in.
a2p1U000000RpCMQA0,0011U00000rjUivQAE,Convenient for downtown Humana associates.
a2p1U000000Rq86QAC,0011U00000rjCJSQA2,"If they work for DOC I will tell them about XYZ.  If not, I won't."
a2p1U000000RoH6QAK,0011U00000rk5tWQAQ,I was able to get in on time and I like the Dr.
a2p1U000000RtFVQA0,0011U00000rjvlhQAA,"I like the service XYZ offers however, I do seem to have trouble getting an appointment that fits my schedule at the Broomfield office.  They seem to be closed every time I need to get in on short notice.  I was able to get an appointment at the Arvada office to see if I had the flu.  They were very prompt and helpful.  Dr Hernandez was very friendly and explained all my options."
a2p1U000000RpmWQAS,0011U00000riks3QAA,Very nice people and service.
a2p1U000000RoUqQAK,0011U00000riV8JQAU,"This is my first time, initial visit. Still testing the waters."
a2p1U000000RtPxQAK,0011U00000rizjTQAQ,I love having everything done all in the same clinic.  Everyone is helpful and extremely nice.
a2p1U000000l8G5QAI,0011U00000rik3jQAA,Only tried them once...so far
a2p1U000000RqRPQA0,0011U00000rjCJGQA2,"Very hard to find out about doctors on the website. Really, it's just the website. It's terrible."
a2p1U000000RqABQA0,0011U00000riYeZQAU,"quick scheduling, convenient location"
a2p1U000000RodYQAS,0011U00000rjaiyQAA,I would only recommend to coworkers because of it being on site.
a2p1U000000RoCFQA0,0011U00000rk74vQAA,They do a good job.
a2p1U000000Rpz3QAC,0011U00000rhwjYQAQ,"Felt welcoming, quick but thorough"
a2p1U000000RoWQQA0,0011U00000riE3QQAU,"I did not have a good experience. I went to see the Doctor because I had a cold and I wanted to find a primary care Doctor. As soon as she steps into her office she says, ""how do you end up with our insurance"" what king of a question is that? anyway. I also wanted to get a referral to see an aye doctor as my eye lids are very dry, she didn't even bother to check my eyelids, instead she said I needed to see an eye doctor as I may have an infection, so I asked for a referral and she said that they always use the eye doctor at St. Anthony's, that's was her ""referral"", no name given at all. Then, we go into some personal questions about my recent labs, I had labs done back in Feb 2019 and I told her I could show her anything from my phone as I have a united healthcare app that will show my recent labs and she told me, I needed to make copies of those labs results and bring them in the next time we have an appointment, she said, ""'we are old school here, please make copies yourself"". That was really an awful experience."
a2p1U000000RqcIQAS,0011U00000rjBP7QAM,I enjoy the Dr and staff
a2p3g000000KzqTAAS,0011U00000rjYMKQA2,Great program! not affordable or individuals :(
a2p1U000000RsrPQAS,0011U00000rju11QAA,I like the longer appointment durations which gives me more time to ask  questions.  I appreciate not having to wait in the office to see the doctor.
a2p1U000000RqBrQAK,0011U00000rkBCRQA2,"I went with the hope of getting an x-ray for my back pain. I was told it was muscular and should keep icing and applying heat and take Tylenol. This pain has been since November. It dissipated somewhat this last month however after the doctor palpating the upper area, it flared up severely causing burning pain all the way through my arms, shoulders, entire upper back.  I truly believe there is something impinging on a nerve since it burns and feels like the entire upper back is being ripped apart.  I was given no x-ray.  This was my experience however others may not have the same issue. The doctor was very cordial, very attentive given the amount of issues I went in with.  Also, I went in because I have been having diaphragmatic spasms (perhaps) which also started when my back pain started-exactly at the same time. This again was back in November. However two weeks ago, I began having some gastritis. The doctor prescribed proton-inhibitor and said the gastritis is causing the diaphragmatic hiccupping, wretching. Again, I believe there was too much information for her but I needed her to understand that the diaphragmatic problem began almost 4-5 months ago and the gastritis just within the last 2 weeks. I don't believe there is a correlation with my chronic issues versus my acute. Otherwise, I hope to work more with this doctor. I believe she knows her stuff. I just really wish we had more time to discuss issues instead of always racing against the clock then not getting anything accomplished."
a2p4w000002O4CZAA0,0014w00002pPZwzAAG,Very friendly and help full.
a2p4w000002O3kLAAS,0011U00000rjksBQAQ,Late on call in appointment. My doctor is out on medical leave so only option given is a nurse practitioner not another doctor.
a2p1U000000RovwQAC,0011U00000riHdYQAU,Because they are not in a union of on medicare
a2p1U000000RsmcQAC,0011U00000rinNPQAY,It's a good format and personable.  I like not having the copays.
a2p3g000000LAasAAG,0011U00000rj9hWQAQ,Only have to use it for work reasons.
a2p3g000000KzHJAA0,0011U00000rjWhWQAU,Chequeo anual

a2p3g000000LAfJAAW,0011U00000rj0cIQAQ,"Every time I've needed an appointment I found it very easy to schedule. Although the video and phone chats are not """"normal"""" I felt like all my questions were answered. It was also really nice not having to pack the kids up and physically have to be in an office."
a2p1U000000RurUQAS,0011U00000riuNUQAY,Not having to wait by the appointment time.
a2p1U000000RpluQAC,0011U00000rjZgDQAU,XYZ is very convenient. Dr. Everett is very friendly and helpful.
a2p1U000000Rp8LQAS,0011U00000sgxbcQAA,Overall I like the concept of XYZ. It's like concierge medicine. There is generally no waiting for appts either. Primary care is easier through XYZ.
a2p1U000000RuqRQAS,0011U00000rhtBgQAI,Very friendly & helpful
a2p1U000000l8H4QAI,0011U00000rk2ZvQAI,"Simple process, friendly staff"
a2p1U000000RsgFQAS,0011U00000rjrboQAA,Quality of care and time spent with physician are better than I have had previously.
a2p1U000000RqZHQA0,0011U00000rijxNQAQ,waiting time is minimal
a2p1U000000RpGQQA0,0011U00000rjiXQQAY,"First, I just built a trusting relationship with my Dr (who I thought of as my Primary Care Physician) and now she is leaving in September. Secondly, this concept buy-in of Paleadina was sold as ""you can get in to see your Dr. the same day or two. On several occasions, when I needed to see my Dr (I was very ill), I could not get in for 6 weeks. Ended up going to King Soopers Little Clinic. Lastly, I plan to retire within a few years and once that happens, I am told I will no longer be able to use teh XYZ services."
a2p1U000000RsrWQAS,0011U00000rjP4BQAU,I do not know anyone who uses United Heath Care.
a2p1U000000RpUAQA0,0011U00000rihuzQAA,I love the friendly staff at my local clinic. I feel comfortable during any visit.
a2p3g000000L2PFAA0,0011U00000riy7cQAA,"cost, access"
a2p3g000000KylXAAS,0011U00000riUE9QAM,convenience of being located onsite / this visit was no where as bad as my last visit. the provider that seen me this time I feel addressed my current health issue and did not shun me away due to my medical history.
a2p1U000000RsVdQAK,0011U00000rjuWxQAI,"While a good concept and convenient location, I have reservations on not being able to select my own physician, and a concerting experience with a prior physician"
a2p1U000000RtJ2QAK,0011U00000riu6NQAQ,Convenience is the main reason I would.  There are a few employee issues that need to be worked out to make this a truely great experience.
a2p1U000000RoRfQAK,0011U00000riBG9QAM,"Easy enrollment, very friendly and helpful staff on the phone and in the office.  As the daughter of a Dr, it was nice to feel like I was really being listened too and was with a Dr who truly wanted to know and care for her patients."
a2p1U000000Ro7RQAS,0011U00000ri3vDQAQ,I sometimes feel as though the Dr is trying to save the insurance company money above my health care needs.  I had already been to a specialist and the XYZ Dr told me that those specialist are just trying to make money off patents.  Also I was told to use a pharmacy in town and not the on-line pharmacy and was charged an excessive amount of my money out of pocket.
a2p1U000000RoAhQAK,0011U00000rj0MtQAI,"fast service, good people. what more could you want?"
a2p4w000002O4WjAAK,0014w00002pPkxnAAC,Convenient and friendly

a2p1U000000RqIhQAK,0011U00000rj7gUQAQ,Very convenient
a2p1U000000RsZPQA0,0011U00000riIWBQA2,"Nurse was unable to complete a blood draw because the previous time she and I tried this I passed out (a first for me) and she was therefore very nervous this time.  After three attempts, she finally sent me to an external blood testing facility (which I do appreciate and which I think should always be protocol)."
a2p1U000000RspZQAS,0011U00000rjkdBQAQ,Non-hurried appointments and interested doctors (keep in mind my company pays the fee so I'm not sure what that is). It seems a great option for people who otherwise frequently visit the doctor.
a2p1U000000RsVVQA0,0011U00000rjyg6QAA,I am satisfied with my care and the staff.
a2p1U000000Ro6oQAC,0011U00000ripDZQAY,yes
a2p1U000000l8JgQAI,0011U00000rhynIQAQ,"Very skeptical that you will soon be without a Dr. and possibly for how long? When I call, nobody ever answers the phone!"
a2p1U000000RtGrQAK,0011U00000riYJYQA2,"Doctor Malfese is easily accessible, staff is friendly and helpful. There are two locations nearby."
a2p1U000000RtKVQA0,0011U00000rhsCkQAI,Friendly Staff that can be reached at any time
a2p1U000000RsXaQAK,0011U00000rjIRCQA2,This was without a doubt the worst example of patient service that I have ever experienced. I agree to be a part of this because I wanted to suppport my husband and his decision. However I will not be a patient of XYZ Health.
